A major contributor to the decrease was Apple’s \nSupplier Clean Energy Program, which lowered our carbon footprint by nearly 3.6 million metric \ntons compared to last year. We also made several product design changes that reduced our \ncarbon footprint, like sourcing aluminum made with hydroelectricity and recycled content, \nimproving product energy efficiency, and redesigning integrated circuits to use less silicon. \nTogether, these product design changes resulted in 4.8 million fewer metric tons of carbon \nemissions compared to last year.\nHistorically, Apple’s carbon footprint has paralleled its financial performance.

Where feasible, we source our own renewable energy by building our \nown projects, including solar, wind, biogas fuel cells, and low-impact hydro projects.\n• Equity investment.  In some markets, we invest capital to become part owner of new \nsolar PV or wind projects and match that renewable generation with our energy use.\n• Long-term renewable energy contracts.

Standard recycled \naluminum accumulates impurities each time it’s recycled. So we engineered an alloy that can \naccommodate scrap sources of aluminum and delivers the same strength, durability, and \nflawless finish. We use sophisticated computational models to identify an alloy chemistry that \ncan withstand a countless number of recycling loops. Our own products and processes are a \nvaluable source of aluminum scrap for our custom alloy, including iPhone enclosures recovered \nby Daisy. In fall 2018, we introduced MacBook Air and Mac mini models with  \n100 percent recycled aluminum enclosures. And use of recycled materials helped cut the \ncarbon footprint of each product nearly in half. In 2019, these efforts will allow us to avoid \nmining more than 900,000 metric tons of aluminum-bearing bauxite.\nCobalt17\nWe use cobalt primarily in batteries. A limited supply of recycled cobalt is available on the \nmarket for use in batteries like ours, not because recyclers lack the ability to recover cobalt, \nbut because many recyclers don’t have enough scrap sources, like batteries. So we set out \nto find new sources of scrap for our recyclers, starting with our own supply chain. We began \nsending iPhone batteries recovered from Daisy, Apple’s iPhone disassembly robot, to our \nupstream recycler in Apple’s battery supply chain. And after a successful pilot program, select \nbattery and final assembly suppliers now send Apple’s battery scrap to our recycler upstream. \nRecycled cobalt from both scrap sources is being recycled into the batteries of new Apple \nproducts—a true circular supply chain.\nCopper\nAs a highly conductive metal, copper is used to make our printed circuit boards, cables, and \nconnectors.

We seek to reduce and remove toxins, by developing new, safer chemistries. \nWhen there is not an existing alternative to a chemical we’ve determined harmful, we innovate. \nWe work with our suppliers to develop custom chemistries made with safer substances. To find \na replacement for PVC and phthalates, for example, we and our suppliers invested in four years \nof research and development to create power cords and headphone cables that had both the \nperformance and chemistry that met Apple standards.27 This deep commitment to innovating on \nsafer chemistries sets Apple apart from many others who still use PVC and phthalates in their cables.\nWe began to identify and phase out harmful substances in the late 1990s, beginning with PVC in our \npackaging, and moving on to the lead that was in our display glass and solder.28 Since then, we’ve \nalso replaced mercury displays with energy efficient and mercury-free LEDs and OLEDs; eliminated \narsenic from display glass;29 replaced brominated flame retardants from thousands of parts such as \nenclosures, cables, circuit boards, and connectors, using safer metal hydroxides and phosphorus \ncompounds in their place;30 and eliminated beryllium-copper connectors and springs from all new \nproduct designs. \nWe’re also focused on replacing harmful substances in manufacturing process chemicals to keep \nworkers in our supply chain safe. We have long been engaging with our manufacturing partners \nto ensure safe working conditions. After analyzing the chemical composition of cleaners and \ndegreasers used at supplier final assembly sites, we chose to go a step further and replace all \nidentified hazardous chemicals with safer alternatives such as ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, glycerol, \nand water. In our first year of this Safer Cleaner Substitution program, we helped 18 sites replace 24 \nproblematic formulations.31 In addition, in 2018, we added n-Propyl Bromide (nPB) to our RSS list of \nbanned process chemicals for cleaning and degreasing.

Apple is working to phase out the use of these exempted \nsubstances where technically possible.\n8  While Apple’s phaseout covers the vast majority of products and components, products by Beddit, which Apple recently acquired, and some older Apple product designs may not be fully BFR- free and PVC- free. However, these \nproducts, including their replacement parts and accessories, were still designed to meet regulatory requirements.\nOverview of Apple’s product life cycle carbon assessment (LCA) methodology\nApple uses five steps when conducting a product LCA.\n1. To model the manufacturing phase, we use part-by-part measurements of the entire product along with data on part production. The measurements help us accurately determine the size and weight of the components and \nmaterials in the product, while data on manufacturing processes and yield loss during production allows us to account for the impact of manufacturing. The LCA includes accessories, packaging, and units that are repaired and \nreplaced through AppleCare.\n2. To model customer use, we measure the power consumed by a product while it is running in a simulated scenario. Daily usage patterns are specific to each product and are a mixture of actual and modeled customer use data. For \nthe purposes of our assessment, years of use, which are based on first owners, are modeled to be four years for macOS and tvOS devices and three years for iOS and watchOS devices. Most Apple products last longer and are \npassed along, resold, or returned to Apple by the first owner for others to use. More information on our product energy use is provided in our Product Environmental Reports.\n3. To model transportation, we use data collected on shipments of single products and multipack units by land, sea, and air. We account for transporting materials between manufacturing sites; transporting products from \nmanufacturing sites to regional distribution hubs; transporting products from regional distribution hubs to individual customers; and transporting products from final customers to recycling facilities.\n4. To model recycling, we use material composition data on our products and cover the treatment steps carried out by the recycler to obtain metal, plastic, and glass material streams. Subsequent processing and remelting steps are \nnot included, as these are considered stages of production and not end-of -life processing.\n5. After we collect data about production, use, transport, and recycling, we combine it with detailed greenhouse gas emission data.",

For the top component contributors to Apple’s carbon emissions, Apple addresses this uncertainty by developing detailed process-based \nenvironmental models with Apple-specific parameters.

Thanks to this new option, in 2015 we announced our second Nevada solar project, \nthe 50-megawatt Boulder Solar II project. This project came online in 2017 , producing  \n137 million kWh of renewable energy a year.\nWe have used the Nevada Green Rider two more times, first for the 200-megawatt Techren \nSolar II project.

So we set an even more ambitious \ngoal  — to make our products carbon neutral by 2030, across our entire \nsupply chain and the lifetime energy use of our customers’ devices. \nTeams across Apple quickly got to work, and thanks to their innovations, \nwe’ve made extraordinary  progress.\nIn this year’s report, you’ll find the most detailed portrait yet of where we \nare today and where we’re headed. Here’s the big picture: Since 2015, \nwe’ve reduced our emissions by over 45 percent . We did it while reaching \nmore Apple users than ever before. And, in doing so, we demonstrated \nthat the choice between a thriving business and a thriving planet is a \nfalse  one.\nThis was also the year we called on our suppliers to accelerate",

The stakes are fundamental:  \nHuman rights like life, health, food,  \nand an adequate standard of living  \nface grave risks, disproportionately  \naffecting low-income and historically  \nmarginalized communities. The worst,  \nand potentially irreversible, impacts  \nof climate change can be prevented  \nwith global, comprehensive, and  \nimmediate  action. As a large global company, we believe it’s our \nresponsibility to take strong, decisive, and inclusive steps \nto mitigate our impact on the climate. We’ve committed to \nachieving carbon neutrality across our entire value chain \nby 2030  — reducing emissions by 75 percent  compared \nwith 2015 and balancing the residual emissions with \nhigh-quality carbon removal.7 This means that our goal \nto be carbon neutral also extends to all our products. This \ngoal is more aggressive than the Intergovernmental Panel \non Climate Change’s recommendation for global carbon \nneutrality within 20 years.8\nApple is also committed to working toward reaching a \n90 percent  reduction in emissions from our 2015 baseline \nby 2050.

But we’ve already made progress by cutting \nemissions across our value chain by over 45 percent  \nsince  2015.We began by making the transition to sourcing \n100 percent  renewable electricity at our offices, retail \nstores, and data centers, which we achieved in 2018. \nAnd in 2020, we achieved carbon neutrality for our \ncorporate emissions.9\nOur philosophy for achieving carbon neutrality follows \nthese  principles:\nCalculate our footprint across our value chain:  Our \nresponsibility extends beyond our direct operations to \nour product-related emissions.

For example, we’ll look \nto reduce emissions from electricity by using renewable \nor low-carbon electricity and decrease emissions from \ntransportation by using alternative fuels and lower-\ncarbon modes of transport.

These \nchoices directly impact the safety, \nrecyclability, and reuse of our \nproducts, which are key to truly \ncircular supply  chains. Smarter chemistry is our approach to identifying \nchemicals that best serve all our priorities, including \nsafety, performance, and environmental impact. This \nsupports our circular supply chain efforts by minimizing \nthe recirculation of potentially harmful substances. Our \nefforts to remove potentially harmful chemicals from \nour products help create safer and healthier workplaces \nfor our employees and suppliers, and safe products for \npeople and the  environment. \nOur approach to limiting potential chemical exposure \nin product manufacturing leverages the hierarchy of \ncontrols. The hierarchy of controls is a concept used to \ncontrol hazard exposure and consists of five actions in \norder of preference: elimination, substitution, engineering \ncontrols, administrative controls, and personal protective \nequipment (PPE). Elimination and substitution are the \nmost preferred forms of control. When no alternative is \navailable to eliminate or substitute potential exposure, \nwe rely on engineering and administrative controls \nto safeguard against it. As we focus on this for our \nmanufacturing processes, we push our industry to do \nthe same. \nWe’ve taken the important initial step of accounting for \nthe materials that we use, both in our products and in \nthe processes to create them. This information helps \nus better protect the people who design, make, use, \nand recycle our devices. It also informs our efforts to protect the environment. We’re working side by side with \n",

The following details the five steps we \nuse to conduct our LCA:\n1. To model the manufacturing phase, we use part-by-\npart measurements of the entire product along with \ndata on part production. In some cases where part-by-\npart data is not readily available, we also use design-\nlevel data for size and weight detail. The measurements \nhelp us accurately determine the size and weight of \nthe components and materials in the product, while \ndata on manufacturing processes and yield loss during \nproduction allows us to account for the impact of \nmanufacturing. The LCA includes accessories and \npackaging, as well as decreased emissions through \nApple’s Supplier Clean Energy Program. When \ncalculating Apple’s comprehensive carbon footprint, \nwe also include units that are repaired and replaced \nthrough  AppleCare.2. To model customer use, we measure the power \nconsumed by a product while it is running in a \nsimulated scenario. Daily usage patterns are specific \nto each product and are a mixture of actual and \nmodeled customer use data. For the purposes of our \nassessment, years of use, which are based on first \nowners, are modeled to be four years for macOS and \ntvOS devices and three years for iOS, iPadOS, and \nwatchOS devices.

To model transportation, we use data collected on \nshipments of single products and multipack units by \nland, sea, and air. We account for transporting materials \nbetween manufacturing sites; transporting products \nfrom manufacturing sites to regional distribution hubs; \ntransporting products from regional distribution hubs to \nindividual customers; and transporting products from \nfinal customers to recycling  facilities.4. To model end of life, we use material composition data \non our products and estimate the ratio of products \nthat are sent to recycling or disposal. For products \nsent to recycling, we capture the initial processing by \nthe recycler to prepare the product for recovery of \nelectronic, metal, plastic, and glass material streams. \nSubsequent downstream recycling processes are not \nincluded, as these are considered stages of production \nand not end-of-life processing. For products sent to \ndisposal, we capture the emissions associated with \nlandfilling or incineration of each type of material.\n5. After we collect data about manufacturing, use, \ntransportation, and end of life, we combine it with \ndetailed greenhouse gas emission data. This emission \ndata is based on a combination of Apple-specific and \nindustry-average data sets for material production, \nmanufacturing processes, electricity generation, \nand transportation. Renewable energy used in the \nsupply chain, initiated by suppliers independently or \nthrough the Apple Supplier Clean Energy Program, is \nalso accounted for within the LCA model.

We’ve \nlearned a lot about how best to \nsecure renewable energy, which has \nhelped us educate suppliers and \nexpand our renewable energy efforts \ninto our supply chain. This appendix \nsummarizes the types of renewable \nenergy solutions we’ve deployed, \nand it details how we implement \nrenewable energy at our data \ncenters  — our largest energy  loads.How we procure renewable  energy\nSince launching our renewable energy program in 2011, \nwe’ve implemented a number of solutions to procure \nrenewable energy. Our strategy has evolved over time \nto create the most positive  impact.\nOwnership and  PURPA\nIn 2011, Apple’s 100 percent  equity ownership of our \nMaiden solar arrays was the first time a nonenergy \ncommercial company built its own utility-scale solar PV \nproject. We used a 1978 federal law called the Public \nUtility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) to structure the \nproject. We then applied this same structure to two \nmore large solar PV and biogas fuel cell projects in North \nCarolina and two microhydro projects in Oregon. This \nwas a landmark moment in corporate renewable energy \ndevelopment and led to an increased use of PURPA in \nthese  states.\nDirect  Access\nSince 2012, in California and Oregon, we’ve used a \nprogram called Direct Access to bypass the default \nelectricity generation offered by the utilities servicing \nour data centers in those states. Instead, we contracted \ndirectly with independent power producers who could \nsupply 100 percent  renewable electricity. After initially \nbuying from existing, third-party-owned projects, we’re \nnow procuring renewable energy from projects we \ncreated: The Solar Star II and Montague Wind projects \ndeliver renewables to our Oregon data center, and the \nCalifornia Flats solar",

The Nevada GreenEnergy \nRider enables us to secure a long-term, fixed-price \ncontract for renewable electricity from a new solar PV \nproject built for us but managed by the utility. We’ve used \nthis partnership to create four solar projects totaling \n320 megawatts.\nEquity  investment\nIn 2014, we invested in two 20-megawatt solar PV \nprojects in Sichuan, China, to support all our in-country \nretail stores, corporate offices, and data storage facilities. \nThis project represented the first time a commercial \ncompany created a new large-scale project in China for \nits own use. We’ve since replicated this model many times \nfor Apple’s supply  chain.\nPortfolio  solutions\nIn 2015 and 2016, we adapted to land scarcity constraints \nin Singapore and Japan by contracting for solar PV on \n800 rooftops in Singapore and 300 in Japan. We adapted \nour approach in each country to fit local partnerships and \nregulatory structures: We signed a long-term agreement \nsimilar to a power purchase agreement in Singapore and \nmade an equity investment in Japan. These projects offer \nus long-term flexibility as our load  grows.Renewable  microgrid\nSince 2017, we’ve been powering Apple Park with \n100 percent  renewable energy  — about 75 percent  of \nwhich is generated onsite and managed by a microgrid. \nThe onsite generation comes from 14 m egawatts of \nrooftop solar PV and 4 megawatts of baseload biogas fuel \ncells. Any additional energy required is drawn by Direct \nAccess from the California Flats solar project in nearby \nMonterey County. The microgrid system with battery \nstorage manages the renewable energy generation \nand the building’s energy use; optimizes demand \nmanagement, load shifting, and frequency regulation \nservices; and ensures uninterrupted energy reliability \nagainst local grid outages.2023 Environmental Progress Report  86 Climate Change Resources Smarter Chemistry Engagement and Advocacy Introduction Appendix\nFacilities renewable \nenergy  projects",

We’re staying at 100 percent  \neven as Apple’s data center presence continues to grow.\nWe now operate eight data centers, and more are being \ndeveloped. These data centers are spread across North \nAmerica, Europe, and Asia. Each has unique design \nfeatures that conserve energy and reflect the climate, as \nwell as other aspects, of its location.Maiden, North Carolina  \n100 percent renewable since opening June 2010\nBetween 2011 and 2015, we installed 68 m egawatts of \nApple-created projects: two 20-megawatt solar projects, \nan 18-megawatt solar project, and 10 m egawatts of \nbiogas fuel cells. We then worked with the local utility, \nDuke Energy, to help build five solar projects through its \nGreen Source Rider program. These solar projects came \nonline beginning in 2015 and were Duke Energy’s first \nGreen Source Rider projects to become operational. We \nworked with Duke Energy for several years to develop \nthis green energy tariff option, which allowed Apple and \nDuke Energy to develop new renewable energy projects. \nThe five Green Source Rider projects have a combined capacity of 22 m egawatts.

These efforts are \nhelping reduce product-related carbon emissions, create \na more resilient supply chain, and contribute to healthier \ncommunities  — while offering a model for others to follow.\nWe’re proud of the progress our suppliers have made. \nAs of March 2023, over 250 m anufacturing partners in \n28 countries have committed to 100 percent  renewable \nelectricity for Apple production (see below for the \nsuppliers participating). Additionally, Apple itself has \ndirectly invested in nearly 500 m egawatts of renewable \nelectricity projects to cover a portion of upstream \nemissions. The Supplier Clean Energy Program now \nhas over 20 gigawatts of clean energy commitments, \nof which nearly two-thirds are operational. In 2022, the \n13.7 gigawatts of renewable energy online in Apple’s \nsupply chain generated 23. 7 million megawatt-hours of \nclean energy, avoiding 17. 4 million metric tons of carbon \nemissions  — a 23 percent  increase over 2021.1Apple’s clean energy  standards\nWe help our suppliers select projects with the greatest \npotential for impact and with a clear carbon, ecological, \nand social benefit, and we consider the life cycle \nemissions associated with current and emerging clean \nenergy technologies. In most cases, wind and solar \nsolutions meet our criteria. For some energy solutions, \nsuch as biomass and hydroelectric generation, we \nreview individual projects so that they deliver positive \nimpact while minimizing harm.

The scope of the fiber and plastic \npackaging footprint includes Apple’s corporate packaging fiber and plastic usage from \nproducts, retail operations and Apple care services. The packaging fiber and plastic \nfootprint tracks the total amount of plastic, virgin and recycled wood fibre, that Apple uses \nin packaging. Apple obtains and analyses supplier-specific data for each product line and \nsums up these figures for the entire company using sell-in numbers. For some products, a \nrepresentative supplier is chosen to calculate the product-specifc packaging. The output is a \ntotal packaging fiber and plastic footprint.

Well this year we did both, \nsetting ambitious goals for Apple while helping more than 100 \nof our suppliers commit to joining our journey to being carbon \nneutral. That progress was powered by our new renewable \nenergy projects spanning the globe—from an award-winning,  \n180-acre solar project in Reno, Nevada, to two of the \nworld’s largest onshore wind turbines in Denmark.\nWhile we helped bring more than 4 gigawatts of renewable \nenergy online, we doubled down on our efforts to remove \ncarbon from the atmosphere. That included an innovative new \npartnership with Conservation International and Goldman Sachs \ncalled the Restore Fund to invest in working forests, revitalizing \necosystems with the goal of removing 1 million metric tonnes of \ncarbon every year.Shaping all of this work is Apple’s commitment to equity. At this \nmoment of rebuilding, we know we can help spur an economic \nrecovery that tackles systemic barriers to opportunity and \nempowers local communities—especially the communities \nmost vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.\nOne way we’re doing this is with the Impact Accelerator we \nlaunched last year, which invests in minority-owned businesses \non the cutting edge of green technology and clean power. \nThe Accelerator is part of our $100 million Racial Equity and \nJustice Initiative, which is advancing equitable opportunity \nin our economy, our schools, and our criminal justice system.\nBut our commitment to equity goes much further. Everything, \nfrom our clean energy investments to our partnerships, considers \nthe impacts on the local community. And we continue to ask \nourselves how we can make our work an even greater force \nfor good.\nIn every case, the answer is to listen, to engage, and to work \ntogether.

The future success of our company depends on taking \nurgent and decisive action. For years, we have increased energy \nefficiency and the use of renewable energy, yet we know we have \nto do more. That’s why last year, we unveiled our most ambitious \nplan to date: to achieve carbon neutrality for the entire life cycle \nof our products by 2030. This goal places us 20 years ahead of \nthe recommendations put forward by the Intergovernmental Panel \non Climate Change (the United Nations body for assessing the \nscience related to climate change) calling for carbon neutrality \nas a planet by 2050. The science is clear: Our world cannot wait \nfor an inclusive, carbon neutral economy. Every business has a \nresponsibility to create a meaningful plan to reduce its emissions.\nOur goal and approach are informed by science. We focus on \navoiding activities that generate carbon in the first place. And, \nwherever possible, we’re switching to lower-carbon alternatives. \nIn cases where emissions can’t be avoided, we’ll then remove  \nthe equivalent amount of carbon from the atmosphere. While \nwe pursue viable solutions, we also align to the same carbon \nmitigation hierarchy in our strategy. It isn’t the easiest approach, \nbut it’s the one science shows is necessary to address \nclimate change.Our approach\nOur philosophy for achieving carbon neutrality follows \nthese principles:\n• Taking a comprehensive approach:  Our responsibility \nextends beyond our direct operations to the entire life cycle \nof our products.

This reduction \naligns with what current climate science shows is necessary \nto limit warming to 1.5° Celsius. We’ll invest in high-quality \ncarbon removal projects to address the emissions that \nremain, prioritizing the protection of ecosystems as a \npowerful, natural carbon solution. These projects will also \nalign to rigorous international standards to ensure their impact. \nAnd by avoiding emissions first, we’ll also reduce the carbon \nwe need to remove.\n• Match solutions to sources:  For each activity within our \nvalue chain, we will choose decarbonization actions that tie \nto the source of those emissions.

We’ve learned \na lot about how best to secure renewable \nenergy, which has helped us educate suppliers \nand expand our renewable energy efforts into \nour supply chain. This appendix summarizes \nthe types of renewable energy solutions we’ve \ndeployed, and details how we implement \nrenewable energy at our data centers—our \nlargest energy loads.\nHow we procure renewable energy\nSince launching our renewable energy program in 2011, we \nhave implemented a number of solutions to procure renewable \nenergy. Our strategy has evolved over time to create the most \npositive impact.\nOwnership and PURPA:\nIn 2011, Apple’s 100 percent equity ownership of our Maiden \nsolar arrays was the first time a non-energy commercial company \nbuilt its own utility-scale solar PV project. We used a 1978 federal \nlaw called the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) to \nstructure the project. We then applied this same structure to two \nmore large solar PV and biogas fuel cell projects in North Carolina \nand two micro-hydro projects in Oregon. This was a landmark \nmoment in corporate renewable energy development and led to \nan increased use of PURPA in these states.\nDirect Access:\nSince 2012, in California and Oregon, we’ve used a program \ncalled Direct Access to bypass the default electricity generation \noffered by the utilities servicing our data centers in those \nstates. Instead, we contracted directly with independent power \nproducers who could supply 100 percent renewable electricity.After initially buying from existing, third-party owned projects, \nwe’re now procuring renewable energy from projects we created: \nThe Solar Star II and Montague Wind projects deliver renewables \nto our Oregon",

With no \nPURPA or Direct Access options in Nevada, we worked directly \nwith the local utility, NV Energy, to create a whole new regulatory \nstructure. The “Nevada Green Rider” enables us to secure a \nlong-term, fixed-price contract for renewable electricity from \na new solar PV project built for us, but managed by the utility. \nWe’ve used this partnership to create four solar projects totaling \n320 megawatts.\nEquity investment:\nIn 2014, we invested in two 20-megawatt solar PV projects in \nSichuan, China, to support all of our in-country retail stores, \ncorporate offices, and data storage facilities. This project \nrepresented the first time a commercial company created a \nnew large-scale project in China for its own use. We’ve since \nreplicated this model many times for Apple’s supply chain.\nPortfolio solutions:\nIn 2015 and 2016, we adapted to land scarcity constraints in \nSingapore and Japan by contracting for solar PV on 800 rooftops \nin Singapore and 300 in Japan. We adapted our approach in \neach country to fit local partnerships and regulatory structures: \nWe signed a long-term agreement similar to a power purchase \nagreement in Singapore and made an equity investment in Japan. \nThese projects offer us long-term flexibility as our load grows.\nRenewable microgrid:\nSince 2017, we’ve been powering Apple Park with 100 percent \nrenewable energy—about 75 percent of which is generated \nonsite and managed by a microgrid. The onsite generation \ncomes from 14 megawatts of rooftop solar PV and 4 megawatts \nof baseload biogas fuel cells. Any additional energy required is \ndrawn by Direct Access from the California Flats solar project \nin nearby Monterey County. The microgrid system with battery \nstorage manages the renewable energy generation and the \nbuilding’s energy use; optimizes demand management, load \nshifting, and frequency regulation services; and ensures \nuninterrupted energy reliability against local grid outages.Appendix CEnvironmental Progress Report  73\n Introduction        Climate Change        Resources        Sm",

Both data centers \nare scheduled to come online in 2021, and we have lined up \nrenewable projects in China to supply the data centers with 100 \npercent renewable energy. \nAir quality \nData centers often rely on diesel-powered emergency generators \nto provide a backup source of power in case of electrical outages. \nEmergency generators must be exercised periodically to ensure \ntheir operational reliability. These preventative maintenance \nactivities as well as emergency operations during power outages \nconsume diesel fuel and result in air pollutant emissions. As a \nsource of air pollutant emissions, the emergency generators at \nApple’s data centers are operated under air permits issued by \nregulatory agencies. These permits require monitoring, testing, \ninspection, and reporting at regular intervals.\nWe’ve voluntarily installed emissions control systems on \nour emergency generators to reduce emissions of nitrogen \noxides and particulates. And we’re standardizing our approach \nto preventative maintenance activities to minimize annual \ntesting hours.\nTo further reduce air emissions at our data centers, we’re \nfinding innovative ways to minimize the use of diesel-powered \nemergency generators. In Denmark, we’ve deployed a new \nsubstation design, in conjunction with the local utility, with the \nhighest level of resiliency and automation. It will allow Apple \nto eliminate emergency generators altogether—in addition to \neliminating air emissions associated with diesel fuel delivery.

We ask our suppliers to have recycled content \nverified by an independent third party to a standard that conforms to ISO 14021. \n Bio-based plastics:  Bio-based plastics are made from biological sources rather than from fossil-fuel sources. Bio-based plastics allow us to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.\n Renewable materials:  We define bio-materials as those that can be regenerated in a human lifespan, like paper fibers or sugarcane. Bio-materials can help us use fewer finite \nresources. But even though bio-materials have the ability to regrow, they are not always managed responsibly. Renewable materials are a type of bio-material managed in a way \nthat enables continuous production without depleting earth’s resources.

As we work to decarbonize our company, Amazon is \ngrowing rapidly. We scaled our business at an unprecedented \npace to help meet the needs of our customers through the \npandemic.

As companies \ninvest in new products and services, and their businesses \ngrow substantially, the focus should not be solely on a \ncompany’s carbon footprint in terms of absolute carbon \nemissions, but also on whether it’s lowering its carbon \nintensity. Over time, continued decreases in carbon intensity \ncan lead to lower absolute emissions. \nWhile we’ve had success cutting emissions from some \noperations, we are still early in the process of transforming \nothers, including powering our operations with 100% \nrenewable energy, developing more-sustainable \ntransportation infrastructure, constructing more-sustainable \nbuildings, decarbonizing the supply chain, and others.

As of June 2020, Amazon has 91 solar and wind \nprojects across the globe that have the capacity to generate over 2900 megawatts (MW) and deliver more than  \n7.6 million megawatt hours (MWh) of energy annually – enough to power more than 680,000 U.S. homes.\nIn March 2020, Amazon announced four new renewable energy projects – the first in Australia, second in Sweden, \nsecond in Spain and 11th in the Commonwealth of Virginia in the U.S. Combined, these projects are expected to \nproduce almost 300 MW of additional renewable capacity and approximately 840,000 MWh of energy annually \n – enough to power more than 76,000 average U.S. homes.\nOne of our latest solar projects in the U.S. is a solar farm in Pittsylvania County, Virginia, which will power Amazon’s new \nVirginia headquarters and other Amazon-owned operations across the Commonwealth, including Whole Foods Markets and \nfulfilment centres. The project is planned for completion by the first quarter of 2022. Amazon has contracted 82 megawatts \n(MW) of the new 120 MW solar farm, which is expected to generate 172,500 MWh of renewable energy annually. \nAmazon was ranked number one in the U.S. by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) for corporate on-site \nsolar installed in 2018. These installations offset the carbon dioxide equivalent of more than 200 million miles of truck \ndeliveries.\nOur largest wind project to date, Amazon Wind Farm Texas, is a 253 MW wind farm in Scurry County in the western part  \nof the state. With more than 100 turbines, the project generates 1 million MWh of wind energy annually – enough to \npower almost 90,000 U.S. homes for a year.\nAmazon is on a path to powering our operations with 100 % renewable energy as \npart of our goal to reach net zero carbon by 2040. \n",

Our global teams also work closely with suppliers to communicate our human rights \nstandards and help suppliers build their capacity to provide safe and respectful working environments.Amazon aims to be Earth’s most customer-centric company, which means giving \nour customers access to the sustainable products they want. From thousands \nof Amazon-branded products to millions of retail and third-party items sold on \nAmazon, we are working to reduce the environmental impact of the products we \nmanufacture and provide customers more information about the sustainability \nattributes associated with the items we sell. AMAZON SUSTAINABILITY    ENVIRONMENT36Household Goods\nMany Amazon customers prioritise safety and sustainability when it comes to household goods such as cleaning supplies \nand personal care products. Customers want to be sure that the products they buy are safe for their families and help \npreserve the planet, without compromising on quality or price. \nWe are working to increase the sustainable attributes of many of our Private Brand selections, from bio-based laundry \ndetergents and washing-up liquids that offer an effective, alternative choice to conventional formulas, to beauty \nproducts that are formulated without harmful chemicals. As part of that commitment, we implemented a Chemicals \nPolicy and Restricted Substance List (RSL), both of which apply to Amazon-owned baby, household cleaning, personal \ncare and beauty brands. To support the broader retail sector’s collabourative effort to use safer formulations and \nproduce more sustainable products, Amazon joined the Retail Leadership Council of the Green Chemistry and Commerce \nCouncil (GC3).\nWe also take an active role in promoting sustainability with our selling partners. For example, we teamed up with Procter \n& Gamble to develop the Tide Eco-Box, a concentrated version of Tide’s traditional laundry detergent compressed into a \nfully recyclable, shipping-safe parcel, which is produced using 60 % less plastic and 30 % less water than a conventional \nplastic jug.

In 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange released a special report  addressing the need for rapid transition and \nwidespread action in the next 12 years if we are to limit global warming to the \n1.5 degree Celsius warming scenario.6 Given this pressing time horizon, it’s \nnow more important than ever for governments, businesses, and individuals \naround the world to take immediate and ambitious action on climate at a \nglobal scale. We believe that Google’s scale, resources, and technological \nexpertise can help the world meet its energy and resource needs in a \nresponsible way that drives innovation and growth. By the end of 2018,  \nNest thermostats had  \nhelped customers \ncumulatively save  \nmore than  \n29  billion  \nkWh of energy.Google’s data center in \nEemshaven, Netherlands\n8\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019 Our approachTaking action\nWith millions more people coming online every month, the demand for \ncomputing power continues to skyrocket and data center capacity continues \nto expand to meet this need. But despite this growth, the total amount \nof electricity used by U.S. data centers has remained constant. Annual \nconsumption increased by 90% from 2000 to 2005, but only by 4% from \n2010 to 2014, largely due to data centers’ ability to improve their efficiency \nas they scale.7 As the use of mobile devices increases and more IT",

We support strong clean-\nenergy and climate-change policies committed to adding clean power to \nthe grid, and we’re partnering with governments and nongovernmental \norganizations to use Google technology to model the effects of climate \nchange on both a global and a local level.9\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019 Our approachOur sustainability goals, like committing to match the electricity use  \nfor our operations with 100% renewable energy, not only are good for  \nthe environment but also make good business sense. By purchasing \nelectricity from renewable sources like wind and solar, we can set a long-term \nfixed price for power. This allows us to gain access to an increasingly cost-\ncompetitive source of electricity, and it helps us save money in the long run. \nBy the end of 2018, we had contracts to purchase more than 3.75 gigawatts \n(GW) of output from renewable energy projects. These contracts have led to \nnearly $5 billion in new capital investment in projects around the world.8 \nWe’re also working to incorporate a climate-resilience strategy into our \noperations that will enable our business and the communities we’re part of to \nthrive despite the effects of climate change. The key principles that serve as \nthe foundation for our strategy are focused on a people-centric framework \nthat’s robust, integrated, diverse, and designed with unique locations, \nscalability, and longevity in mind.9 This framework was used to conduct a \nclimate exposure and vulnerability analysis that enabled us to assess the \nfuture resilience of our current locations and evaluate the climate resilience \nof new developments.

Examples of sustainable water management practices can be \nseen in our data centers, where we keep working to find innovative  \ncooling options where possible, like the use of seawater in Finland,  \nindustrial canal water in Belgium, and air cooling in Ireland. Through  \nGoogle.org, we’ve awarded millions of dollars in grants to promising  \nwater-conservation solutions.11 \nWe see the circular economy as a complex yet inspiring information \nchallenge that, once unlocked, will lead to a world of abundance where \nhuman, environmental, and economic systems can thrive. That’s why \nwe’re leveraging our scale, resources, technological expertise, and close \npartnerships with organizations like the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, as well \nas with other leading companies, to accelerate the transition to a circular \neconomy and help the world meet its resource needs.\nUltimately, our goal is to maximize the reuse of finite resources across \nour operations, products, and supply chains and enable others to do the \nsame.

The issue areas that were found to be of greatest relevance include \nour data centers, workplaces, users, water stewardship, circular economy \nstrategy, and supply chain. Cutting across these priorities is the importance \nof engaging in public policy—at local, state, federal, and international levels—\nto support the success of sustainable business models. \nAs per recommendations from the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force \non Climate-related Financial Disclosures, we have reported our exposure \nto climate-related risks over multiple time horizons in Alphabet’s 2019 CDP \nClimate Change Report .\nGoogle Cloud Platform, G Suite \nProducts, and ToolsData Centers and \nNetworking InfrastructureOffices and  \nResearch/Development SitesConsumer Electronics \nand Services Energy\nNatural \nResourcesManufacturing,\nConstruction, and\nServices\nCustomers and Users Employees and Communities Suppliers and Communities\nEcosystems12\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019 Our approachLooking toward future opportunities \nWe believe global businesses like Google should lead the way in improving \npeople’s lives, while reducing or even eliminating our dependence on raw \nmaterials and fossil fuels.

In 2018, matching our data center electricity \nconsumption with renewable energy reduced embedded water use by  \n88% on average compared with buying grid power.21\nGoogle Environmental Report 2019 Designing efficient data centersIn 2013, we became the first company in North America—and the only \nmajor internet company—to achieve a multi-site energy management system \ncertification to ISO 50001, a voluntary third-party standard. Our energy \nmanagement system intends to cover all of our owned data centers globally \nonce they meet certain operational milestones. In 2018, we maintained \nISO 50001 certification for 12 of our 15 Google-owned and -operated data \ncenters, which together represented 91% of our IT energy use.18\nWe’re also working to design out waste, embedding circular economy \nprinciples into our server management by reusing materials multiple times.  \nIn 2018, 19% of components used for machine upgrades were refurbished \ninventory. When we can’t find a new use for our equipment, we completely \nerase any components that stored data and then resell them. In 2018, we \nresold nearly 3.5 million units into the secondary market for reuse by  \nother organizations.\nWe’re committed to achieving Zero Waste to Landfill19 for our global data \ncenter operations by reducing the amount of waste we generate and finding \nbetter disposal options. In 2018, we diverted 87% of waste from our global \ndata center operations away from landfills.\nIn addition to driving efficiency in our data center operations, we also \nconsider supply chain impacts. Through the efforts of our Responsible Supply \nChain program, we collaborate with stakeholders across our supply chain \nto uphold our high standards for protecting workers and the environment. \nGoogle’s data center in Saint-Ghislain, Belgium22\nGoogle Environmental Report ",

Now we’re taking this system to the next level: instead of human-\nimplemented recommendations, our AI system is directly controlling data \ncenter cooling, while remaining under the expert supervision of our  \ndata center operators. This first-of-its-kind cloud-based control system  \nis now safely delivering energy savings in multiple Google data centers.\nWhereas our original recommendation system had operators vetting \nand implementing actions, our new AI control system directly implements \nthe actions. We’ve purposefully constrained the system’s optimization \nboundaries to a narrower operating regime to prioritize safety and \nreliability, meaning there is a risk/reward trade off in terms of  \nenergy reductions.\nDespite being in place for only a matter of months, the system is already \ndelivering consistent energy savings of around 30 percent on average, \nwith further expected improvements. That’s because these systems get \nbetter over time with more data. Our direct AI control system is finding \nyet more novel ways to manage cooling that have surprised even the data \ncenter operators. Dan Fuenffinger, one of Google’s data center operators \nwho has worked extensively alongside the system, remarked: “It was \namazing to see the AI learn to take advantage of winter conditions and \nproduce colder than normal water, which reduces the energy required for \ncooling within the data center. Rules don’t get better over time,  \nbut AI does.”\nWe’re excited that our direct AI control system is operating safely and \ndependably, while consistently delivering energy savings. However, data \ncenters are just the beginning.

We surpassed this in 2018, exceeding our target seven  \nyears early.\nIn 2012, we set a long-term goal to purchase enough renewable energy to \nmatch all the electricity we consume globally on an annual basis. In 2017, we \nachieved it for the first time: Google’s total purchase of energy from sources \nlike wind and solar matched the amount of electricity used by our operations \naround the world, including our offices and data centers. And in 2018, we \nagain matched 100% of our annual electricity consumption with purchases \nof renewable energy (see Figure 6). This amounted to more than 10 million \nmegawatt-hours (MWh) of energy—more electricity than is used annually \nby the state of Hawaii.27 To date, we’ve purchased a total of nearly 26 million \nMWh of renewable energy.\nWe’re the first company of our size to achieve 100% renewable energy  \ntwo years running.28 While we’re still drawing power from the grid, some \nof which is from fossil fuel resources, we’re purchasing enough renewable \n",

This means realizing a \nfuture where each Google facility is always matched—around the clock—  \nwith local carbon-free power.\nIn October 2018, we published an inside look at the sources of Google's \nelectricity around the globe, to gauge how we're tracking toward our long-\nterm aspiration of sourcing 24x7 carbon-free energy. We shared location-\nspecific “Carbon Heat Maps” to visualize how well a data center is matched \nwith carbon-free energy on an hour-by-hour basis. \nSome of our data centers—like the one in Hamina, Finland—are already \nperforming remarkably well: 97% of the facility’s electricity use last year  \nwas matched with carbon-free sources. Others still have room to improve.\nCreating a carbon-free future will not be easy. It will require innovations \nacross policy, technology, and business models.

To date, the \nproject has donated more than $800,000 to nonprofits, such as United Way \nand Habitat for Humanity, that are helping connect low-income families with \nenergy-assistance programs.\nThe Power Project has also teamed up with nonprofits, utility companies, \nand mortgage financiers to install the Nest Thermostat E—a smart thermostat \nwith proven energy-saving features—in qualified low-income households. \nThis includes every home built by Habitat for Humanity in the United States \nin 2018 and low- and moderate-income households served by organizations \nsuch as Southern California Gas and Fannie Mae. Together, we aim to install \n1 million energy- and money-saving Nest thermostats in low-income U.S. \nhomes in the next five years.\nWhile Google and Nest ultimately envision a more energy-efficient future \nto help combat climate change, the Power Project is working to provide \nenergy savings for families today.",

But, unlike large cities \nlike New York and Berlin, which have access to huge carbon data sets, many \nsmall and midsize cities lack the resources to gather comprehensive data on \nbuilding and transportation emissions. This makes it hard to set firm carbon \ncommitments of their own. \nThe Environmental Insights Explorer (EIE), an online tool created by Google \nin collaboration with the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy, is \ndesigned to provide carbon emissions insights to cities of all sizes—  \nand ultimately accelerate the transition to a low-carbon future. \nDeveloped by the Google Earth Outreach team, EIE analyzes data from \nGoogle Maps and Google’s other climate-related projects, like Project \nSunroof , to surface insights across four categories: building emissions, \ntransportation emissions, solar energy potential, and climate projections. \nEIE pairs this information with third-party data and standard GHG emissions \nfactors, deriving carbon estimates and reduction potential for cities around \nthe world. \nAlthough EIE is starting with a handful of cities initially, Google eventually \nplans to make these insights available to thousands of towns, cities, and \nregions across the globe. “Imagine what we could accomplish if every city in \nthe world were engaged in the fight against climate change,” says Rebecca \nMoore, leader of the Earth Outreach team. “What would the world look like?”\nRead how Environmental Insights Explorer is bringing insights to cities\nThe Environmental Insights Explorer tool provides \ncity-level carbon emissions data.58\nGoogle Environmental",

A PUE of 2.0 means that for every watt of IT power, an additional watt is consumed to cool and distribute power to the IT equipment. A PUE closer to 1.0 means nearly all the \nenergy is used for computing.\n17. According to the Uptime Institute's 2019 Data Center Industry Survey , the global average PUE of respondents’ largest data centers was around 1.67.\n18. This slight decline from 2017 is partly due to new sites not yet included in our energy management system and partly due to a change in how we calculate this number.\n19. At Google, Zero Waste to Landfill means that when waste leaves our operating data centers, none of it goes to a landfill—100% is diverted to more sustainable pathways, with no more \nthan 10% going to a waste-to-energy facility, unless waste to energy can be proved more valuable than alternative diversion paths. Our approach is based on UL’s Environmental Claim \nValidation Procedure for Zero Waste to Landfill. Some waste cannot be diverted away from landfill for regulatory reasons.\n20.

Carbon intensity figures are based on our combined Scope 1 and market-based Scope 2 emissions, with the exception of electricity consumption intensity, which is calculated using \nonly market-based Scope 2 at the data centers.\n40. A carbon offset is an investment in an activity that reduces carbon emissions. The reduction in carbon emissions is represented by a carbon credit. The credit, usually verified by a \nthird party, signifies that GHG emissions are lower than they would have been had no one invested in the offset. One credit equals 1 metric ton (1,000 kilograms or 2,204 pounds) of \ncarbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) prevented from being released into the atmosphere.\n41. CO2e is a quantity that describes, for a given mixture and amount of GHG, the amount of CO2 that would have the same global warming potential (GWP), i.e., the ability of a gas to \ntrap heat in the atmosphere when measured over a specified timescale (generally, 100 years). Some GHGs are more potent than others, as measured by their GWP. Carbon dioxide is \nthe baseline and thus has a GWP of 1.\nCreating sustainable workplaces\n42. Neil E.

Since 2010, we’ve procured renewable energy for our operations, and in 2012, we began publishing how this reduces our overall carbon footprint. Up until 2015, there was no guidance \nfrom WRI on how to account for these emissions reductions, so we developed our own methodology, whereby on an annual basis we assigned renewable electricity procured against \nelectricity consumed (in MWh) in the closest data center to the renewable energy project. In 2015, WRI released new guidance for market-based Scope 2 accounting, which we \nadopted, starting with 2015 data. Our pre-2015 methodology differs from WRI’s in the use of residual mixes, which avoid double-counting of claimed renewable energy attributes.\n58. In 2018, to align with industry best practices for Scope 3 reporting, we extended our reporting boundaries to include emissions associated with food from our corporate offices, \nhardware manufacturing emissions beyond Tier 1 suppliers (full upstream to the point of extraction), use of sold products, and end-of-life treatment of sold products. Google’s \nhardware includes data center servers, networking equipment and consumer hardware products. These extended categories will be reported annually going forward.\n59. In 2016, we adopted the industry practice of including only operational emissions in our carbon neutrality commitment. Our 2016 operational emissions include Scope 1, Scope 2 \n(market-based), and Scope 3 (business travel and employee commuting).

The global energy system needs to deliver more energy with less carbon.\nDemand for energy is set to grow significantly, \ndriven by increases in prosperity in the developing world. Most of the growth in demand comes from developing economies, to support their industry and infrastructure and sustain improvements in living standards.\nCarbon emissions need to fall sharply as the \nworld seeks to move to a lower carbon energy system consistent with meeting the climate goals outlined in the Paris Agreement\n*.BP Energy Outlook 2019\nOur Outlook explores the forces shaping the global energy transition out to 2040 and the key uncertainties surrounding it. The 2019 Outlook considers a range of scenarios. They have some common features, such as ongoing economic growth and a shift towards a lower carbon fuel mix, but differ in terms of policy, technology and behavioural assumptions.\nScenarios\nEvolving transition:  assumes that government \npolicies, technology and social preferences continue to evolve in a manner and speed seen over the recent past.\nRapid transition:  envisages a more rapid \ntransition to a lower carbon energy system, \nthrough a reduction in emissions stemming from greater energy efficiency, fuel switching and use of carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS).\n  For more information see bp.com/energyoutlook . \nThe BP Energy Outlook 2020 will be published \nlater in the year.The changing energy mix \nIncreased demand for energy will be met over the coming decades through a diverse range of supplies, including oil, gas, coal and renewables.\nThe energy mix is shifting as the transition to \na lower carbon energy system continues,",

We use what we learn to focus our sustainability reporting on these key issues.\nOur materiality methodology\nIn 2019 we worked with an external agency to refresh and expand our materiality assessment. We engaged with internal and external stakeholders, asking them to list and prioritize their most significant sustainability or ESG issues. We also asked them to assess the relative impact of these issues on our business and to tell us how influential they think BP can be in creating positive change. As a result, we identified 33 key topics and issues that are important to our business and stakeholders, and their significance relative to each other. We used the results to prioritize our sustainability reporting for 2019 and we plan to build on this in 2020.\nOur materiality assessment process \nStep 1\nSetting the parameters\nWe determined the materiality of BP’s key issues using three \nparameters: importance, impact and influence. Each \nparameter included clearly defined criteria to enhance the \nrigour and robustness of the process and to eliminate \nsubjectivity as much as possible.\n• Importance: the importance of each issue to key internal  \nand external stakeholders.\n•  Impact: the impact of each issue on BP’s future business.\n• Influence: BP’s ability to influence and drive change \nregarding each issue.\nWe collaborated closely with our risk team at this stage of the \nassessment to define the impact criteria and thresholds, as \nwell as throughout the entire process, to ensure alignment.Step 2 \nIdentifying issues\nWe carried out a horizon-\nscanning exercise to identify  \na list of issues for stakeholders to consider and rank. We \nreviewed and considered: \nrelevant ESG frameworks and \nstandards (including Global \nReporting Initiative (GRI), SASB and TCFD); current relevant \nlegislation; global, market  \nand industry-specific trends; existing BP processes, policies \nand documentation, including \nBP’s risk processes; topics \ndiscussed in the media and across our industry.Step 3 \nDetermining the importance  \nof key issues\nUsing our prioritization criteria, we conducted interviews and facilitated \nan online survey with key external \nstakeholders and BP employees to \ngather their perspectives on the \nimportance of BP’s key issues. \nParticipants came from: investor \n",

In \naddition, we used several internal \nconsumer research documents to \ngauge the sustainability priorities of \nour customers and consumers.\nStep 4\nDetermining the impact and influence \nof key issues\nWe ran a survey to gather feedback from senior \nemployees across BP on the impact and \ninfluence of each issue, using our prioritization \ncriteria. To ensure a balanced and representative \nviewpoint, we engaged with individuals working \nacross many different geographies and in \nvarious functions. Again, our risk team was \nclosely involved.  Step 5\nAnalyzing and validating \nWe used qualitative analysis to extract the key themes before consolidating them to create a \nlist of our top ten material issues. We tested and \nvalidated the final results with a working group \nfrom across BP, including experts in human \nrights, social performance and environment, \nrisk and measurement.  Step 6\nOngoing engagement\nThe process of engaging doesn’t \nstop with our materiality research. \nWe continue to gather feedback \nfrom our stakeholders and will use \nthis to inform our next materiality \nassessment.  \n14\nBP Sustainability Report 2019Climate change and  \nthe energy transition\nFocusing attention across BP  \nto tackle greenhouse gas (GHG) \nemissions and advance the  \nenergy transition.\n See page 16 .\nGHG emissions from \nthe use of our products \nHelping customers and consumers \nto reduce their GHG emissions from the use of BP’s products.\n See page 26 .\nGHG emissions from  \nour operations\nReducing GHG emissions from  \nBP’s own operations.\n See page 23 .\nHealth and safety\nProtecting the health and safety of BP’s employees and contractors and preventing incidents through carefully planning operations, identifying potential hazards  \nand managing risks.\n See page 36 .Renewable energy\nPromoting renewable and alternative energy including solar, wind, biofuel, biopower and hydrogen in order to increase  \nthe share of renewables in the energy mix.\n See page 30 .\nSpill prevention\nSeeking to avoid the negative environmental impacts of spills  \nby minimizing the risk of spills, maintaining asset integrity, and maintaining effective spill prevention plans.\n See page 38 .\nBusiness ethics \nand accountability\nConducting business in an ethical, \ntransparent way, and respecting human rights in accordance with BP’s",

In our view, pricing can be effective either as a tax or as a cap-and-trade system.\nA fifth of the world’s GHG emissions are now \ncovered by carbon pricing systems. Stable and well-designed carbon pricing adds a cost to energy production and energy products, but it also provides a basis for future investment and a level playing field for all energy sources. \nWe believe that a well-designed price on \ncarbon should: \n• Apply to all quantifiable GHG emissions in all sectors of the economy on a CO\n2 \nequivalent basis.\n• Pre-empt future and replace existing regulations that overlap or duplicate the carbon price.\n• Prevent the shifting of emissions and jobs from one country or jurisdiction to another to avoid carbon taxation.\nWe recognize that carbon pricing may not always be the best solution and that in some cases a range of policy instruments may be required to address gaps in pricing coverage or market failures.\nCarbon pricing in Washington \nState, US\nWe support well-designed carbon pricing \nbut we’re prepared to oppose poorly \ndesigned proposals. \nFor example, we opposed the ballot initiative \nto introduce a carbon fee in Washington \nState, US, in November 2018. We believed \nthat the policy was badly designed and \nwould have harmed Washington’s economy \nwithout significantly reducing carbon emissions. The initiative was not passed.\nWe worked with legislative leaders in the \nstate in 2019 and 2020 and supported a \ncap-and-invest bill, which we believed \nwould be more effective. We intend to work \nwith the Washington legislature during its \n2021 session to see if a new carbon bill can \nbe advanced.Leading in transparency\nIn February 2020, we announced our aim to be recognized as an industry leader for the transparency of our reporting. This means providing our stakeholders with the information they require, particularly in relation to our low carbon strategy and aims.\nAt the 2019 BP AGM, the board recommended \nthat shareholders support a special resolution requisitioned by Climate Action 100+ on climate change disclosures.

When burned for power, natural gas has, on average on a lifecycle basis, about half the GHG emissions of coal, with fewer air pollutants, so expanding its use globally to displace coal will help to reduce carbon emissions. In fact, switching from coal to gas has avoided more than 500MteCO\n2 from \nthe power sector globally since 2010.

We’re exploring its potential to reduce emissions in our operations, improve our products and provide the basis for creating low carbon businesses.\nIn 2019 we joined the Hydrogen Council, \na global CEO-led initiative to promote and support the role of hydrogen in the energy transition. The Council aims to accelerate investment into large-scale commercialization of hydrogen solutions across industries worldwide. We’re also a member of Hydrogen Europe, which seeks to promote and develop large-scale, low carbon hydrogen-based opportunities. In our view, robust policies, including carbon pricing, will be required to incentivize the investment required to exponentially grow the use of hydrogen.We’re exploring the potential of blue hydrogen – hydrogen from natural gas – from which the carbon is captured and stored. We also believe green hydrogen produced from the electrolysis of water using renewable energy will play an increasingly important role, particularly in parts of the world with high renewable energy potential. We use large amounts of hydrogen in our refinery operations. This is typically generated from fossil fuel sources without carbon capture (grey hydrogen).

Its advantages include:\n• Greater energy diversity, including lower carbon fossil fuels.\n• Enabling investment in different energy sources, including low emission hydrogen production from natural gas.\n• Expanding technology choices for decarbonized, flexible and reliable power.\n• Protecting the value of substantial capital investments in power, industrial and manufacturing infrastructure.\n• Employment and investment opportunities in industrial centres.\nAlthough CCUS requires significant upfront investment, over time its deployment at scale can be expected to bring costs down. A third party study in the UK found that for every £1 invested in carbon capture, the pay back to the national economy is almost £5. With an average CCUS project currently capable of capturing at least one million tonnes of CO\n2 every year, the process offers \na cost-effective way to decarbonize, transition to a lower carbon economy, and reach the Paris net zero target. It also creates opportunities to build new low carbon businesses, with the CO\n2 sold to support \nthese ventures.\nCCUS collaborationCollaboration is needed to make CCUS mainstream. It’s been used for more than 20 years, but needs government support, such as carbon pricing and policy making, to accelerate its deployment. Through the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI), we’re identifying the policy mechanisms that could be most effective in scaling CCUS up on a regional basis. In the US, we are also playing a leadership role in a National Petroleum Council (NPC) report.\nWe’re exploring opportunities to deploy \nCCUS in our own operations and projects.

We’re sustaining this through training in key processes, such as isolations or re-instatements and the operation of valves, carried out by our operators. We choose the most appropriate investigation methodology, depending on an incident’s severity and complexity. The most robust methodology we use, for investigating the most serious and complex incidents, is the ‘logic tree’. This is BP investigation training and certification which has been externally accredited by The National Examination Board in Occupational Safety and Health.\nOur risk process has been implemented across \nthe group and is continuously updated to help enable us to use the most effective processes and tools. In Upstream, all of our regions develop annual loss of primary containment (LOPC) plans, which address the key measures they need to take to prevent LOPCs, which comprise the vast majority of all spills.

Robotics has the potential to deliver this impact across the breadth and lifecycle of our operations – from surveying in deserts to decommissioning in deep water. \nIn a first for our industry, we’ve piloted \ntechnology to measure methane emissions from remote offshore platforms in the North Sea, using a drone that has its origins in the hunt for life on Mars. It circled our Clair platform for around 90 minutes while live-streaming data for analysis, completing what may have been the longest civilian drone flight ever undertaken in the UK – more than 185 kilometres. We have plans to roll this methane detection capability out across our North Sea assets in 2020.\nWe now use drones routinely to perform visual \ninspection tasks, which reduces the need for people to work at heights. Their use also enables us to keep hot turbine exhausts or flare stacks operating during inspections, avoiding the increases in emissions that occur during plant shutdown and restart. \nWe’re also testing the use of drones to operate \nin confined spaces – for example the cargo tanks in our floating production systems in Angola – and trialling crawling robots. At our Cherry Point refinery in Washington, US, these are being used to spot microscopic cracks in the internal walls of our hydrocracker reactor. \nEnergy with purpose\nUsing maritime robotics to \nimprove safety\nA new wave of marine and subsea robots is \nrevolutionizing how we understand our \nunderwater operating environment. These \nmaritime robots, more generally known as \nunmanned surface vessels and unmanned \nunderwater vehicles, are loaded with sensors \nand cameras to capture data from the oceans \nsafely and efficiently.\nUsing these robots rather than a conventional \nlarge ship for the same task, could enhance \nsafety by taking crew out of harm’s way.\nThe use of unmanned vessels now forms a part \nof our maritime autonomous systems strategy, \nwhich involves evaluating and piloting new \nrobotic technologies.Security \nHostile actions, including cyber attacks, could harm our people or disrupt our operations.

These included modern slavery and labour rights risks training for plant management and daily site walkovers by BP site supervisors to engage with workers, inform them of their rights and encourage them to speak out about issues. \nThe service companies identified in the audit were \nrequired to attend two days of modern slavery and labour rights training provided at the plant to understand the local context and discuss how some existing site processes could be used to support improved labour rights management. These service companies were also required to make certain commitments on modern slavery and labour rights. The plant made sure that BP labour rights principles are made clearer to contractors, are explained during induction sessions, and are included in the specialist training introduced for high risk contractors in 2019.\nContractors can raise grievances through formal \nand informal channels. These grievances are then followed up and resolved with the relevant contractor companies using the BP labour rights and modern slavery principles as the basis for the discussion. \nFurther actions planned for 2020 include a third \nparty review of the corrective actions being taken by the service companies and a resourcing review including appointment by BP of a dedicated modern slavery and labour rights resource for the country. \n51\nBP Sustainability Report 2019\nIntroduction Sustainability at BP Our focus areas Doing business \nresponsibly Governance Our reporting Lightsource BP is helping shape the future \nof global energy delivery by developing \nsolar capacity around the world.\nDoing business \nresponsibly\nEnvironment\nWe respect the environments in which we \noperate.

Engagement and development\nWe aim to create a positive, empowering culture by listening and responding to our employees’ concerns and ideas. We want our employees to feel valued for their work and impact on the business, rewarding them fairly and competitively, supporting their health and wellbeing, and investing in their development.\nReward\nIt’s important to reward our employees competitively for the great work they do. We think that reward is about more than just pay – it should also include a range of benefits and the opportunity to work and learn in an inclusive and supportive environment. \nOur reward package is based on employee \nperformance, including operating in line with our core values. Every BP employee sets priorities for their contribution to safety and creating value. In 2019 we changed our annual cash bonus, linking it directly to our sustainable emissions reduction (SER) target. This means that for around 37,000 eligible employees, including executives, part of their overall reward is now linked directly to meeting our low carbon emissions targets. In February 2020 we built on this, announcing a new aim to mobilize our workforce to be advocates for net zero. This includes increasing the percentage of remuneration linked to SERs.\nOur executive pay is also linked to performance, \nwith safety, reliable operations and financial performance accounting for one-third of executive bonuses. Tier 1 and tier 2 process safety events and recordable injury frequency are the safety performance measures we use for executive reward.In 2019 more of our employees have found ways of working flexibly, for example by combining home and office time. In the UK a number of teams embraced flexible working, while in Hungary, our Budapest and Szeged offices have used a flexible working model to optimize available space.

It now requires contract transparency for new contracts from 2021, plus new requirements on environmental reporting and gender.\nThis year, we also participated in the multi-\nstakeholder groups in Mauritania, Iraq and Trinidad & Tobago and agreed to join the multi-stakeholder group in Senegal, pending final agreement with the National Committee there. \nWe disclose information on our payments to \ngovernments for our upstream activities on a country-by-country and project basis under national reporting regulations.\nWith our presence in Mauritania and Senegal \nwe launched a programme of capacity-building workshops, helping to promote transparency and local participation in the newly created \nEnergy with purpose\nOur participation in trade associations\nWe believe our membership of trade associations can \nprovide significant benefits – from contributing to the \ndevelopment of equipment or operating and safety \nstandards, through to working with regulators, \nknowledge sharing and professional development. \nSome trade associations engage in lobbying and \nadvocacy on matters that they consider to be \nimportant to their members.\nOur priority is to work to influence within trade \nassociations, but we may publicly dissent or resign \nour membership if there is material misalignment on \nissues that we consider high priority.\nIn 2019 we conducted our first group-wide review of \nclimate policy alignment with a number of the trade associations that we’re members of, selecting 30 that \nare actively involved in the climate debate and most \nrelevant to our stakeholders.

Nothing is\n \nmore important.\nLeaning into greening\nThe strategic progress we have made so far, and the pace at which society has been moving on sustainability, has given us confidence to accelerate the greening of bp. We now expect that by 2025, more than 40% of our capital expenditure will be in our transition growth businesses, and around 50% by 2030.Or take our aim 4, which is to install methane measurement at all our major oil and gas processing sites by 2023. While we work towards that, our methane intensity has come down by more than 40% since 2019 (from 0.12 to 0.07%). This includes reduced operational methane emissions, and more bp-produced gas available to sell to our customers.\nAnd at our Gelsenkirchen sites in Germany, we \nhave reduced our Scope 2 emissions by more than half-a-million tonnes in 2021 (in line with aim 1), helped by our trading team’s long-term arrangement to purchase renewable energy.\nFocused on delivery\nWith our direction set, and the major organizational changes behind us, we are now\n \nfully focused on delivering our strategy \nand \nthe sustainability aims that underpin it.\nThank you for your support and challenge – it has been vital. We could not have made this progress so far without you – and look forward to your continued backing.\nThank you.We have also increased our net zero aims.  \nOn aim 1, we are now aiming to cut our \noperational emissions in half by 2030 (up from 30-35%). And on aim 3 (covering the lifecycle emissions for the energy products we sell) we now aim to reduce carbon intensity to net zero by 2050 or sooner – up from 50% – and have increased the volume of emissions covered by this aim, which now includes physically traded sales of energy products. Uniquely among our peers, we are aiming to be net zero across operations, production and sales.\nDiversifying and decarbonizing\nWe have a lot more to learn, but our experience so far is that our purpose – reimagining energy for people and our planet – can help us diversify and decarbonize bp and at the same time create real value and returns for our",

We intend to apply the principles of a mitigation hierarchy in our aims, emphasizing the role of actions such as direct operations emissions abatement, reducing our upstream oil and gas production, and shifting our sales portfolio towards lower carbon products.  \nQualifying deductions also have a role to play. \nh ( 1) Article 2.1(a) of the Paris Agreement states the goal of “Holding the increase in the global average temperature to well \nbelow 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial \nlevels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change.”  \n(2) Article 4.1 of the Paris Agreement: “In order to achieve the long-term temperature goal set out in Article 2, Parties aim to reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible, recognizing that peaking will take longer for developing country parties, and to undertake rapid reductions thereafter in accordance with best available science, so as to achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century, on the basis of equity, and in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty.”\nbp sustainability report 2021\n19\n•Sustainability at bp\n 2021 at a glance\n Foundations\n Embedding sustainability\n Engaging stakeholders\n Our reporting\n Performance and progressWhat role will divestments \nplay in achieving our net zero\n \naims?\nDivestments are, and continue to be, an \nimportant part of",

We are aiming to increase capital expenditure on our low carbon businesses to $4-6 billion each year by 2030.

Our methane emissions intensity is currently calculated using a generally accepted industry methodology and, while it reflects progress in reducing intensity, it will not directly correlate with progress towards delivering our 2025 target, which is based on our new measurement approach.\nThroughout 2021, we continued working to \nreduce our operational methane emissions – from upgrades in our current operations to advancing the design and use of new technology. Our aim to deploy methane measurement is focused on improving our understanding and confidence in our methane data in an effort to support our efforts to reduce methane intensity and absolute emissions.\nOur methane intensity in 2021 was 0.07%, \nan improvement from 0.12% in 2020\nb. \nMethane emissions from upstream operations, used to calculate our intensity, decreased by 40% to around 43.0kt, from 71.6kt in 2020.

This includes installing air-assisted flares to improve combustion efficiency and thermocouple sensors on all flare stacks that notify bp operations teams of unlit flares. All bpx flares have auto-ignitors to attempt to remotely reignite extinguished flames.At a number of our North Sea assets, we made improvements such as optimizing the restart sequence of our operations and changing operational parameters to minimize the potential for flares to extinguish under high winds. These changes can help minimize methane emissions.\nTechnology improvements\nTechnologies to detect and measure methane \nare evolving at pace. A flexible approach to using different technologies allows us to move towards increased continuous site and source-level measurement systems as more advanced technology becomes available. We use different methods, including drones, aircraft, satellites and fixed video monitoring. We continue to monitor emerging technologies to assess their potential as methane measurement tools.\nAutonomous methane measurement\nIn 2021, bp joined forces with five other \noperators in the North Sea and with the Net Zero Technology Centre to develop a method for offshore methane measurements using autonomous aircraft. The method is designed to meet emerging requirements for atmospheric measurements under the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 (OGMP). It combines a state-of-the-art methane sensor with a fixed wing autonomous aircraft capable of operating in challenging environments, such as the North Sea. This allows emissions data to be collected while minimizing the requirement for personnel to be present in the offshore environment, reducing overall risk.\na Methane  intensity refers to the amount of methane emissions from bp’s operated upstream oil and gas assets as a percentage of the total gas that goes to market from those operations. \nOur methodology is aligned with the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative’s (OGCI).\nb Methane  intensity is currently calculated using",

But it is more than 25 times more potent than CO\n2 over a 100-\nyear time span.\nReducing methane emissions could \ndramatically reduce the pace of warming. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), methane was the second largest contributor to warming over the last decade to 2019, with almost 60% of the impact of carbon dioxide.  \nDuring the COP26 climate change conference \nin Glasgow, UK, 103 countries signed the Global Methane Pledge to reduce global methane emissions by 30% by 2030 against a 2020 baseline. In the US, the Environmental Protection Agency has proposed the adoption of federal regulations that will require oil and gas operators to detect and repair methane leaks. \nThis is a critical step toward helping the US \nreach net zero by 2050 or sooner and we look forward to continuing to engage with the Agency as it develops methane rules.More $ for   new energies\nOur aim 5 is to increase the \nproportion\n \nof investment we make \ninto\n \nour non-oil and gas businesses.\nOver time, as investment goes up in low \nand zero carbon, we see it going down in oil and gas.\nProgress and targets\nAnnual $ investment in low carbon\n2020 performance\n2030 aim2025 target2021 performance$750m\n$3-4bn\n~$5bn~$2.2bn\nOur progress in 2021\nAs we continue towards our net zero ambition, \nwe target increasing our low carbon investment to $3-4 billion per year in 202",

In the UK, bp and 50-50 partner EnBW were jointly selected as the preferred bidders for two 60-year leases in the UK’s first offshore wind leasing round in a decade – development of these projects, Morgan and Mona, is expected to add up to 3GW offshore wind capacity in the UK. \nIn January 2022, together with EnBW, we were \nawarded a lease option to develop a major offshore wind project around 60km offshore from Aberdeen, Scotland. This project, to be known as Morven, will have a potential generating capacity of around 2.9GW, sufficient to power more than three million homes.\nSolarLightsource bp is further accelerating growth, \nnow targeting up to 25GW by 2025 and will be exclusively developing a potential 9GW solar pipeline for bp following the acquisition of 7X Energy in 2021. Lightsource bp continued to grow its operational portfolio in the US, Europe and Australia in 2021, including new markets in Greece and Poland.\nIn June 2021, Vendima, five flagship Lightsource \nbp solar projects, began commercial operations in Zaragoza, Spain. The five-project cluster has a total capacity to provide around 250MWp of solar energy, producing electricity which is the equivalent of powering over 107,000 homes. \nThese projects also aim to improve local \nbiodiversity by planting native species and positively contributing to the local economy through job creation.5\nbp sustainability report 2021\n26\n•Sustainability at bp\n 2021 at a glance\n Foundations\n Embedding sustainability\n Engaging stakeholders\n Our reporting\n Performance and progress1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11",

We have codified what we have learned both internally and externally over the past two years into our company pandemic plans.\nIn 2021, we maintained our focus on mental \nhealth and wellbeing. We enhanced our in-house training programmes, with 14,000 employees attending some form of mental health training across more than 250 sessions – an increase in attendance of 8% compared with 2020. This training covered a range of topics, including resilience, burnout, managing change and leadership mental health skills. We continued our partnership with Headspace and increased the number of family and friends eligible to enrol. By the end of 2021 more than 10,900 employees and family members had signed up to the app.\nIn October 2021, we ran a comprehensive \nactivity programme to support World Mental Health Day, including awareness, discussion and learning sessions and, for the third year running, a video in which employees shared their own mental health struggles. More than 5,000 people watched the video and more than 5,500 visited the event website.bp is a founding partner of The Global Business Collaboration for Better Workplace Mental Health and in December 2021, members of our mental health network contributed to the collaboration’s video and guide on empowering employees to share their mental health experiences. We have extended the provision of training for our leaders on mental health, although this work is in its early stages. \nCommunity health and wellbeing\nWe have made progress on identifying ways of supporting our community health and wellbeing objectives, including research, benchmarking and engagement with stakeholders. We will continue developing our priorities for action and will set specific objectives for our work on community health and wellbeing.\nOur partnership with the mental health charity \nMind continued in 2021.

For example, at our Castellon refinery, water consumption was reduced by approximately 176,000 m\n3, by feeding osmosis \nwater to the cooling towers. There was an increase in freshwater use at our bpx energy operations during 2021.\nWe actively manage our freshwater demands \nin\n \nareas of stress and scarcity. Based on analysis \nusing the World Resources Institute (WRI) Aqueduct Global Water Risk Atlas, four of our 17 major operating sites were located in regions with medium to extremely high water stress in 2021. Based on anticipated changes in the areas WRI marks as water stressed, this number may increase to 12 by 2040, assuming a business-as-usual scenario with no portfolio changes.At major operating sites, 0.1% of our total freshwater withdrawals and 0.6% of freshwater consumption were from regions with high or extremely high water stress in 2021 (compared with 4% and 8% respectively in 2020). This is mainly due to the divestment of Geel Chemicals and the WRI’s downgrading of the location of the Kwinana refinery to being a location with low\n \nbaseline water stress, both of which took \nplace in 2021.\nOur wastewater treatment performance \nwas\n \nflat\n \nin 2021.

We intend to measure the impact of any collaborations through the application of volumetric water benefits (VWBs) as defined by WRI\nb. \nIn 2021, we defined different kinds of replenishment activities, worked to identify operating sites in stressed and scarce water catchments at which interventions are needed, and consulted potential partners. We are looking to launch our first programme in 2022.\nIn some instances, we are already taking action \nto help replenish water in local communities. For example, in Mauritania and Senegal, where fresh water is a scarce resource, access to clean water was identified as a priority during the project consultation with the communities in N’diago, where thousands of people often experience long-term water shortages. \nFollowing feedback from the communities \nand\n \nthrough collaboration with our business and \nimplementing partners, we launched a project in April 2020 to bring clean water to the area, which  continued into 2021. \nThe project has involved extending and renovating \nthe N’diago water supply network, including construction of a 200 m³ water tower and a distribution network.

The models were less sophisticated and more uncertain than they are today, but the implications were already worrying. Thirty years later much has changed. The threat is now more immediate, but the world is also taking action—from governmental policy and technology innovation to actions by individuals and organizations—driven by a broader awareness of the danger.\nI worked on Search for 20 years, leading the product for \nmany of those, and learned a lot about the unique impact Google can have on the world. I’ve always been proud of Google’s leadership in pushing the boundaries of sustainability in our data centers, including achieving carbon neutrality in 2007 (at the time, such accomplishments were uncommon). Going further, we’ve matched 100% of our global electricity use with renewable energy purchases for the last six years—a goal that seemed almost crazy when we set it in 2012. \nToday our ambitions have evolved—we now have a bold \ngoal to achieve net-zero emissions across all of our operations and value chain, and as part of that goal, to run on 24/7 carbon-free energy on every grid where we operate. The path to get to these goals is difficult, and we’re committed to working through the challenges we face with the ultimate aim of driving larger systems change to create a more sustainable future. Further, predicting the future growth of energy use and emissions from AI compute in our data centers is difficult. Despite this, we remain focused on developing new ways to make AI computing more efficient while leveraging the opportunities that AI presents to have a positive environmental impact. \nBeyond our own footprint, Google’s founding mission—\n“Organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful”—can play a very important role in accelerating progress in climate information and action. A sustainable future will be built upon billions of decisions made by governments, organizations, and individuals, which will need to be grounded in good information. Increasingly, we see through Google Trends that more and more people are looking for ways to live sustainably. I believe that we",

But this information often lives in silos and is hard to access. Making the information accessible and useful can be a tough technical challenge. Our products like Environmental Insights Explorer, Earth Engine, and Data Commons are key solutions to support the decisions that cities and organizations will have to make. Information can also have a significant impact on the decisions of individuals—particularly in the areas of home energy and transportation. Our products like Maps, Search, and Nest reach billions of users around the world, and we’re building many features to respond to the demand for that information in our products. \nGiven the scale of the problem, innovation  will also be \nkey to getting us to a better future. In order to push the \nfrontiers of innovation, Google has long had a world-class research organization that’s been at the forefront of AI and machine learning. These solutions can help in predicting \nmore extreme weather (flood forecasting, for instance), optimizing systems from traffic lights to car routes, and mitigating climate change in new ways, for example. \nIn our 2023 Environmental Report, we’re highlighting how \nthese themes of information and innovation run through much of our work:\nFor information, we’ll feature Google Trends  \ninsights alongside key initiatives to show how our work is informed by societal trends and expectations.\nAnd for innovation, we’ll call out the many  \nplaces where AI is helping to break down  barriers and advance our work.\nOver my tenure at Google, I’ve seen how we’ve been working to integrate sustainability into our work. This transition is going to be challenging—both for us and for the world at large—and there’s no playbook for making it happen. But we see our efforts as part of a bigger picture, setting our goals to help scale global solutions, and I’m optimistic that we can, through our efforts in both information and innovation, play a helpful role in building a more sustainable and resilient future.\nBenedict  Gomes\nBenedict GomesSVP, Learning & SustainabilityGoogleBy making information accessible and \naccelerating innovation, we can help \ncreate a more sustainable future.   5\n2023 Environmental Report  \nA letter",

Today, I’m raising my daughter in these same special places, but now these delicate ecosystems are threatened, just like many other parts of the world. \nClimate change affects all aspects of society, from food \nproduction and human health to infrastructure and the economy. These impacts are interconnected and can have a cascading effect on people and the planet. The response calls for systemic, global action to reduce emissions, improve watershed health, maximize the reuse of finite resources, and protect biodiversity.\nSince Google was founded, our efforts to mitigate climate \nchange have started with our own operations, and we’ve worked hard to lead by example with the ultimate goal of driving larger systemic change. In our third decade of climate action, we’ll continue to take a science-based approach to our efforts, while sharing our own lessons and progress with others. \nI joined Google eight years ago to lead our sustainability \nefforts, and have witnessed our sense of urgency and ambition firsthand. We’re empowering individuals, governments, businesses, and other organizations to make decisions that can drive positive action for people and our planet.\nThe opportunity we have through our products and \nplatforms is reflected in our updated environmental sustainability strategy, which focuses on where we can make the most significant positive impact. Our work is organized around three key pillars: empowering individuals to take action, working together with our partners and customers, and operating our business sustainably.\nIn 2022, we reached our goal to help 1 billion people \nmake more sustainable choices through our products. We achieved this by offering sustainability features like eco-friendly routing in Google Maps, energy efficiency features in Google Nest thermostats, and carbon emissions information in Google Flights. Looking ahead, our aspiration is to help individuals, cities, and other partners collectively reduce 1 gigaton of their carbon equivalent emissions annually by 2030.\n 2\nAfter two years of condensed reporting, we’re sharing a deeper dive into our approach in one place in our 2023 Environmental Report.

Our approach to AI must be both bold and responsible . To us, that means developing AI in a \nway that maximizes the positive benefits to society while addressing the challenges, guided by our AI Principles . \nWe can use AI to help accelerate solutions to tackle climate change by providing better information  to \nindividuals, operational optimization  for organizations, \nand improved prediction  and forecasting.

For example, Google Cloud customers can reduce their cloud footprint with a feature called Active Assist, which uses machine learning to identify unused (and potentially wasteful) workloads that could reduce carbon emissions if removed.\nOur planet, as seen via Google Earth ©2020 Landsat / Copernicus\nWe believe that AI is a foundational and transformational technology that will provide compelling and helpful \nbenefits to people and society through its capacity to assist, complement, empower, and inspire people in almost every field of human endeavor. It has the potential to contribute to tackling some of society’s most pressing challenges and opportunities—among these, climate and sustainability, where we’re researching and innovating to help unlock scientific discoveries and to assist people in making informed choices and communities impacted by climate change. \nWe believe that getting AI right—which to us involves innovating and delivering widely accessible benefits to \npeople and society, while mitigating its risks—must be a collective effort involving us and others, including researchers, developers, users (individuals, businesses, and other organizations), governments, regulators, and citizens. It’s critical that we collectively earn public trust if AI is to deliver on its potential for people and society. As a company, we embrace the opportunity to work with others to get AI right.\nJames ManyikaSVP, Research, Technology, & SocietyGoogle\n   10\n2023 Environmental Report  \nWe’re making advancements  in many \ntransformative areas of AI, but I’m particularly \nexcited about AI for Social Good, including  climate adaptation.

With AI at an inflection point, predicting the future growth of energy use and emissions from AI compute in our data centers is challenging. Historically, research  has shown \nthat as AI/ML compute demand has gone up, the energy needed to power this technology has increased at a much slower rate than many forecasts predicted. We have used tested practices to reduce the carbon footprint of workloads by large margins; together these principles have reduced the energy of training a model by up to 100x and emissions by up to 1,000x. We plan to continue applying these tested practices and to keep developing new ways to make AI computing more efficient.\nGoogle data centers are designed, built, and operated to \nmaximize efficiency—even as computing demand grows.

This is an ambitious vision that we’ve set to push us to contribute meaningfully to helping with climate solutions beyond our own operations and value chain.\nWe initially focused on helping cities and local \ngovernments reduce 1 GT of emissions. A key tool in this effort is the Environmental Insights Explorer (EIE), which provides actionable climate and sustainability data to government officials in cities and regions worldwide. It’s been used in multiple ways across the globe, including by city leaders in Dublin to analyze bicycle usage and inform smart transportation policies, and by the city of Austin to prioritize planting trees in areas with the highest need.\nTo better reflect the broader group of partners we aim to \nhelp, we’re updating our shared ambition:\nASPIRATION\nWe aim to help individuals, cities,  \nand other partners collectively reduce 1 gigaton of their carbon equivalent emissions annually by 2030.For context, 1 GT is comparable to the entire annual \nemissions of Japan. 22 Helping others to reduce 1 GT of \ncarbon equivalent emissions per year, starting in 2030, is a bold aspiration focused on where we can have the most impact—enabling others to reduce emissions in key areas like energy and transportation. Our ultimate measure of success will be how much we’ve helped individuals, cities, and other partners to achieve their own greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction goals.\nMany of the solutions to achieve a gigaton of carbon \nemission reductions don’t yet exist. However this ambition pushes us to innovate and be audacious in our approach and to collaborate with others to drive systemic solutions. We’ll share progress and learnings along the way.\nEstimating impact\nEstimating the carbon impact of actions taken by many millions of people, communities, and organizations will be inherently difficult, imprecise, and fundamentally different from measuring a corporate carbon footprint.

We know that our responsibility begins with our own carbon footprint, which is why we’ve taken significant steps over the past two decades to minimize our own emissions. In 2021, we set our most ambitious goal yet: to achieve net-zero emissions  across all of our operations \nand value chain by 2030. To accomplish this, we aim to reduce 50% of our combined Scope 1, Scope 2 (market-based), and Scope 3 absolute emissions (versus our 2019 baseline) before 2030, and plan to invest in nature-based and technology-based carbon removal solutions to neutralize our remaining emissions. We’ve formally committed to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) to seek their validation of our absolute emissions reduction target.\nOne of the key levers for reducing emissions from our \noperations is transitioning to clean energy. Energy use contributes to a significant share of our carbon footprint due to the electricity needs of our operations—in particular, our data centers. That’s why, in 2020, we set a goal to operate our data centers and office campuses on 24/7 carbon-free energy  on every grid where we operate by \n2030 (24/7 CFE). We’ve been working hard to transition our operations and the electricity grids that serve us to cleaner sources of power, through a combination of clean energy procurement, technology innovation, and policy advocacy. And we expect our work to decarbonize electricity grids where we operate to contribute to decarbonization across our value chain as well.\nCharting our path\nAchieving net-zero emissions and 24/7 CFE by 2030 are extremely ambitious goals—what we call “moonshots.” We also know that our path to net-zero emissions won’t be easy or linear; it may require us to navigate significant uncertainty and deploy new systems and technologies across our business. Some of our plans will take years to deliver their full results, particularly where they involve building new large-scale infrastructure with long lead times. So as our business continues to evolve, we expect our emissions to rise before dropping towards our absolute emissions reduction target.\nIn our third decade of climate action , we recognize that \nwe can’t achieve our goals alone. Transitioning to a carbon-\nfree future will require stronger government policies and partnerships with many other organizations, as well as new technologies and structural changes to the broader systems that serve our operations and value chain,  \nsuch as electricity grids and hardware supply",

For example:\nGrowing energy needs\n• As we work towards our absolute 50% emissions reduction target, our business is continuing to evolve to meet the needs of a rapidly digitalizing world, and to harness the opportunities presented by  AI technology.\n• Our operations and value chain are global and involve a diverse range of industries, which means we must make progress within hard-to-abate sectors and carbon-intensive geographies, such as the Asia Pacific region. \n• We have a large number of different suppliers, both direct and indirect, each with climate programs that differ widely in maturity. In some cases, this limits our ability to successfully influence them, and to collect the data needed to accurately estimate our  Scope 3 emissions.\nAvailability of carbon-free energy\n• There are often long lead times between our investments and resulting GHG reductions. For example, with new wind and solar projects, it can take years before projects that we contract are constructed and begin to generate clean electricity. \n• System-level decarbonization is proceeding more slowly than needed in many regions and sectors, and while we aim to accelerate these changes through our efforts and engagement, they aren’t within our control.\nUse of carbon removals\n• Because the carbon removals sector is in the earliest stage of development, costs are currently high, and there are limited volumes of removals available for purchase.\n 68\nAs we move towards our net-zero goal, the scale of these challenges will only increase, along with the difficulty of additional progress.

The majority of these emissions come from upstream manufacturing of consumer hardware products, the production of capital goods we have purchased for use in our data centers, and data center construction. After accounting for the impact of renewable energy procurement through PPAs, Scope 3 emissions represent 75% of our carbon footprint.\nFor more information on our GHG emissions, see the \nReporting approach and methodology  section and our \nEnvironmental data tables .   36\n2023 Environmental Report  Reducing carbon emissions\nWe’re working to reduce our emissions across our \noperations and value chain.

Had we not made these changes, we estimate that our reported Scope 3 emissions would have been approximately 18% higher, remaining relatively flat when compared to the prior year (see Figure 12).\nOur Scope 2 (market-based) emissions increased by \n37%, primarily due to increased data center electricity consumption and a lack of full regional coverage of renewable energy procurement in the United States  and Asia Pacific regions.In 2022, we reported Scope 2 (location-based) emissions of 8.0 million tCO\n2e, which doesn’t take into account our \nrenewable energy procurement, and Scope 2 (market-based) emissions of 2.5 million tCO\n2e.

We share three case studies where Google recently signed CFE Manager agreements—in Virginia, Germany, and California—and discuss some contractual terms and issues that buyers pursuing these agreements should consider.\nIn addition to the CFE manager model, in 2022 we piloted \na new approach to clean energy requests for proposals that can reduce the time to negotiate and execute a clean energy PPA by up to 80%. We’re hopeful this new approach will give clean energy buyers and sellers useful new options for negotiating PPAs, and enable all organizations that want to decarbonize their electricity use to join us on the journey to 24/7 CFE.\nHelping local communities\nFinally, we believe that our clean energy procurement shouldn’t only benefit the climate, but also the local communities that host our facilities—in particular, historically underserved communities  that haven’t \ntypically benefited from the clean energy transition. Three years ago, we started a journey to better understand how we can help lower barriers to an equitable clean energy transition, culminating in two additions to our clean energy procurement approach that respond to those challenges. \nThe first program extends clean energy’s financial \nbenefits to local communities. Through a first-of-its-kind partnership with EDPR NA Distributed Generation , \nwe’ll create a 500 MW community-based solar portfolio, adding clean energy to the regional U.S. PJM power grid and providing Google with Renewable Energy Credits that contribute to 24/7 CFE . At least 10% of the portfolio’s \nrevenues will be redirected annually for up to 15 years as utility bill credits to more than 25,000 households facing a high energy burden. \nThe second program aims to spur long-term investments \nto improve housing infrastructure. Through a partnership with Sol Systems , we’re providing funding to three rural \nelectric cooperatives and one regional organization with deep roots in North Carolina and South Carolina to undertake critical home pre-weatherization and safety upgrades for low- and moderate-income households.

Learn more in our  Bay View spotlight .\n • Managing energy demand across our global operations: We developed a “carbon-intelligent computing platform” that optimizes the timing and location of computing tasks based on local CFE availability. This allows us to shift some of our data centers’ computing tasks to the times of day when local solar and wind power are most plentiful, and  to shift tasks geographically  across data centers so \nthat we can do more computing in regions where  CFE is abundant.\n • Accelerating next generation energy sources:  \nIn 2021, we signed the first corporate agreement to develop a next-generation geothermal  power project, \nand in 2022, we installed the first-ever battery-based backup  power system for a data center at our \nfacility in St. Ghislain, Belgium.

The electricity grids in many countries where our suppliers operate lack sufficient carbon-free energy capacity to support rapidly growing demand, and may even face energy shortages that affect not just manufacturing but also the communities and livelihoods of the people in these regions. Our long-term vision is that all of our suppliers—for hardware manufacturing, transport, logistics, and indirect services—and their communities have access to reliable, cost-effective, carbon-free energy. And we’ll get there only through significant global investment in new wind, solar, and other clean energy capacity, as well as more robust grid systems.In addition to purchasing renewable energy for our own operations, we also make targeted investments in renewable energy. Investment in renewable capacity is a scalable approach to creating system-level change by driving grid decarbonization and enabling greater access to carbon-free energy. This is especially significant in markets where credible procurement mechanisms for clean energy are nascent or nonexistent. We aim to invest in clean energy projects that reduce emissions and serve manufacturing operations across our supply chain.\nGoogle aims to enable 5 GW of new carbon-free \nenergy through investments in our key manufacturing regions by 2030. In 2022, we signed agreements to invest approximately $350 million to support 0.5 GW of renewable energy projects towards this 5 GW total. This builds on our long-standing track record in this space; From 2010 to 2022, we entered into agreements to invest nearly $2.9 billion in renewable energy projects with an expected combined generation capacity of approximately 4.2 GW.\nTowards our 5 GW goal, Google’s investments will be \ntargeted to support bringing additional carbon-free energy capacity online in key manufacturing regions around the globe, including in North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia Pacific.

Global search interest in     “pollinators ”    and   \n   “tree planting ”     reached all-time highs in 2022. 139 \nIn urban areas around the world, we’re designing nature into the built environment to improve urban biodiversity and connect people to nature. For example, our Platform G building in London’s King’s Cross neighborhood will include \na biodiverse green roof and planting palette designed to support native birds, bats, bees, and insects, designed in collaboration with the London Wildlife Trust. A densely planted outdoor roof garden with a rainwater irrigation system will provide a habitat for protected species of bats and birds, as well as offering a quiet green space for breaks during the work day. We’re collaborating with the London Wildlife Trust as part of a wider initiative to protect our native species and improve local biodiversity.\nIn city centers lacking greenspace, the urban heat island \neffect produces higher temperatures, leading to increased energy needs, air pollution, and heat-related illness.\n 140 \nGoogle is helping to abate the urban heat island effect by prioritizing plantings, green open spaces, and tree canopy cover on our campuses, as well as reducing impermeable surfaces like concrete. \nWe published insights from some of this work in an \nacademic paper , aiming to inspire others and provide them \nwith tools and techniques for integrating nature into dense urban areas. \nA monarch butterfly at our Charleston East campus.

In the Bay Area and elsewhere across our portfolio where appropriate, we nurture nature by supporting restoration efforts beyond our campuses and by planning for resilience. We also connect people and nature by providing community access to nature and improving worker health through biophilic design.\nNurturing nature across \necosystems\nWe invest in restoration projects outside of Google’s \ncampuses to build health across the wider ecosystem and accelerate our water stewardship goals. In addition to grants mentioned above to create and maintain pollinator habitat, we also support efforts to strengthen the ecological resilience of critical natural systems like the San Francisco Bay . In 2022, we partnered with the \nSan Francisco Estuary Institute to create the Shoreline Resilience Framework for Wildlife Support , which is being \nused by regional agencies to identify, map, and enhance functions that contribute to shoreline resilience. These functions may include protecting the shoreline from erosion, supporting threatened and endangered species, and maintaining critical landscape processes like marsh migration with sea-level rise.Connecting communities \nand nature\nWe invest for the long term, so we want to care for the \nenvironments and communities where we operate. We engage with local communities and leading programming that extends the benefits of nature to all. For example, in partnership with the Santa Clara Valley Audubon Society, the City of Mountain View, and other organizations, Google hosts “Egret Office Hours” at the Shorebird Way rookery  so the public can safely see \nmoments throughout the egret breeding cycle. \nAs another example, we created the Green Loop, a \npublicly accessible pedestrian and cycling trail connecting some of our buildings in Mountain View . The Green Loop \nwas designed with native vegetation to enhance habitats for pollinators and other wildlife (including nearly 100 native trees), as well as to help manage stormwater.\nWe ensure that Googlers  have access to the benefits \nof high-quality biodiverse nature through incorporating \nexterior landscapes and access to nature on our campuses, as described above. We also focus on bringing attributes of natural environments into our interior spaces by applying biophilic design practices, such as nature-inspired architecture, interior, and landscape design. To further this, we collaborated on an initiative with the ILFI to make a Biophilic Design Toolkit that was launched in 2022",

This integrated geothermal pile system also enabled us to electrify the building’s overall systems more effectively, because recycling ground heat requires less energy than creating new heat. Bay View also features our largest electric kitchen, through which we’re learning lessons that will inform the transition of all our kitchens to electric cooking.\nWater stewardship\nTo help address local water scarcity, Bay View is on track to meet the LBC’s definition of “ net water positive ,” \nmeaning it’s designed to produce more recycled water than the site requires. Predictive models estimate that the on-site geothermal energy system is expected to help reduce about 90% of the water needed for cooling, compared with a traditional cooling tower system. To further reduce water use, we designed the campus landscapes with native plants and drought-tolerant species that don’t require as much watering.\nWe’re also capturing and reusing water on-site when \npossible. Stormwater retention ponds and constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment were integrated into the site landscape. A central plant treats stormwater gathered from retention ponds and wastewater collected from buildings, producing recycled water that can be used for cooling towers, flushing toilets, and irrigation.\nCircular economy\nBay View incorporates our circularity principles  of \nminimizing waste, keeping materials in use for as long as possible, and promoting healthy materials  that are safe \nfor people and the environment.

Our Chief Sustainability Officer and sustainability teams work to address risks by identifying opportunities to reduce the company’s environmental impacts from its operations and value chain, and through improving climate resilience. \nClimate-related \nrisks\nClimate-related risks and opportunities have long time \nhorizons with high uncertainty regarding how climate trends, policy, and socio-economic factors might evolve in the future. Google continues to build on qualitative and quantitative risk assessments to identify climate-related risks and opportunities, and to understand their associated impact.\nIn 2015, Google developed a set of Principles of Climate \nResilience , which support our definition of climate risk \nand resilience. From there, we created a framework that prioritizes the impact on people (including communities, users, and Googlers), so that it represents the different aspects of climate resilience within Google, as well as the internal and external actors who either influence or are influenced by Google’s climate resilience decisions. These ideas continue to inform how we think about addressing long-term climate risk.\nIn 2020, Google conducted a climate risk assessment, \nwhich included a low and high emissions climate scenario analysis. This assessment modeled the impact of flooding, water stress, extreme heat, and wildfires on 26 priority office sites and 23 data center locations. The key result of this scenario analysis was that increased exposure to extreme heat and flooding is likely to impact many of our global offices and data centers as early as 2030, if not sooner. We consider these results when planning Google’s overall development strategy.\nIn 2022, Google increased its efforts to align our \nclimate risk assessment process more closely with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures  (TCFD), leveraging \nthe TCFD categories of risks and opportunities and conducting climate scenario analyses. In an effort to drive completeness and consistency when reviewing these categories, we adopted our ERM rating scales (i.e., impact, frequency, likelihood, control effectiveness) to identify and prioritize areas of focus.\nIn 2022, climate-related risks and opportunities were \nanalyzed in three time horizons—short term (through 2030), medium term (through 2040), and long term (through 2050)—for financial, operational, legal, and strategic risks.

Indicators from available risk assessment tools, including WRI Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas 3.0 and WWF Water Risk Filter 6.0, are blended with other metrics to evaluate risks related to scarcity, flooding, water quality, sanitation and hygiene, reputation, and regulatory stressors. \nFor our data center operations specifically, in 2022  \nGoogle finalized the development and application of a context-based water risk and impact methodology to generate more granular insights than can be provided by water risk screening tools. It provides a framework to measure and evaluate site-level water risks, and the potential watershed impact, to inform our decision-making process for new site selection, water cooling design, and ongoing operations.To identify and assess water-related risks in our supply chain, we’ve conducted a supply chain water use analysis and a supplier risk assessment using WRI’s Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas, WWF’s Water Risk Filter, and WULCA AWARE . The key risks identified included baseline water \nstress, flood risk, access to safe drinking water, and the level of sanitation and hygiene services. This assessment enabled us to identify priority locations for supplier engagement in Central America, Asia, and the United States.\nTo safeguard the health of local waterways, we stipulate \nthat suppliers “[treat water] as required prior to discharge or disposal of all wastewater.” To support the health and wellbeing of those in the communities we operate in, suppliers must “provide workers with ready access to clean toilet facilities [and] potable water.” We conduct regular supplier audits to monitor adherence to our code of conduct.

We estimate our Scope 3 GHG emissions using the the Greenhouse Gas Protocol’s Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions (version 1.0), in the following categories identified as relevant: \n• Category 1: Purchased goods and services\n• Category 2: Capital goods\n• Category 4: Upstream transportation and distribution\n• Category 6: Business travel\n• Category 7: Employee commuting, including teleworking\n• Category 11: Use of sold products\n• Category 12: End-of-life treatment of sold products\nIn our Environmental data tables , we present certain \nemissions from Category 1, Category 2, Category 11, nd Category 12 as an aggregated subtotal—“Other categories”—for business reasons, as described further below.\nOur Operational Scope 3 emissions are made up of \nCategory 6 and Category 7, and are third-party assured. All reported Scope 3 emissions values are rounded to the nearest thousand.\nCategory 1: “Purchased goods and services” includes \nemissions generated from manufacturing consumer hardware and our food program. To estimate full supply chain emissions generated from manufacturing consumer hardware, we perform third-party-verified Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) in accordance with ISO 14040 and 14044. For our food program, we use LCA emission factors from WRI and annual Bay Area procurement volumes to estimate emissions, which we extrapolate to our global operations using building admittances.\nIn our Environmental data tables , emissions from \nmanufacturing consumer hardware products are \npresented in Category 2: “Capital goods.” Emissions from our food program are presented in “Other categories.”\nCategory 2: “Capital goods”  includes upstream \nemissions from the production of capital goods \nwe’ve purchased, including computing and storage hardware used in our data centers.

Where supplier emissions data isn’t available, we estimate with industry-average GHG intensities by commodity type and spend data. Data center construction emissions are estimated by using an LCA analysis to derive construction emissions data and then applying this to our construction activity. \nIn our Environmental data tables , emissions from our \nTier 1 hardware manufacturing suppliers are presented in \nCategory 2: “Capital goods,” and emissions beyond our Tier 1 hardware manufacturing suppliers are presented in “Other categories.” Data center construction emissions are presented in “Other categories.”\nCategory 4: “Upstream transportation and \ndistribution” includes emissions generated primarily from transportation and warehousing of our consumer    88\n2023 Environmental Report  products and data center equipment. We collect \nconsumer products and data center equipment transportation emissions from our logistics providers. These well-to-wheel (WTW) GHG emissions are calculated based on fuel use or weight-distance data and routing associated with a shipment. Where logistics provider emissions data isn’t available, we use weight and distance data by shipment collected from the providers to estimate WTW emissions, using emissions factors from the 2019 Global Logistics Emissions Council (GLEC) framework. Where logistics provider data isn’t available, emissions are estimated based on reported data from other transportation providers and the number of units shipped. For warehousing emissions, we collect energy data directly from the warehouses and estimate emissions using LCA electricity and fuel factors from the 2022 Sphera LCA for Experts database. Where warehouse energy data isn’t available, we estimate using the 2018 Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) data and the warehouse square footage allocated to Alphabet.\nCategory 6: “Business travel” includes emissions from \nair, rail, and car rental travel. Distance and fuel-based travel data is collected through our online booking system or through a third-party travel agency for all sources. Data obtained from our value chain partners isn’t used at this time. Emissions are calculated using 2022 DEFRA U.K. Government GHG Conversion Factors for air travel, the 2017 WRI/WBCSD GHG Protocol Emission Factors from Cross Sector Tools for rail travel, and the 2023 EPA Center for Corporate Climate Leadership GHG Emission Factors Hub for car rental travel. \nCategory 7:",

To determine the number of commuting trips by mode made in 2022, we surveyed our employees to determine typical commuting patterns and applied these commuting patterns to our global employee population. The calculation uses an average commuting distance for passenger vehicles obtained from the U.S. Department of Transportation’s 2017 National Household Travel Survey and an average fuel efficiency for passenger vehicles obtained from the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Transportation Statistics Table 4–23. Data obtained from our value chain partners isn’t used at this time. Emissions are calculated using 2022 DEFRA U.K. Government GHG Conversion Factors for passenger vehicles. This category also includes teleworking emissions, which we began to estimate and report in 2020, when teleworking became prevalent due to the global pandemic. Teleworking represents emissions generated by employees working remotely from their homes. We apply the estimation methodology outlined in EcoAct’s 2020 Homeworking Emissions white paper to our annual average workforce in 2022.\nCategory 11: “Use of sold products” includes emissions \ngenerated by all of Google’s flagship consumer hardware products sold in 2022. Flagship consumer hardware products are products that can provide their main functionality without connection to another product. For example, this doesn’t include accessories, such as cases. Use impact was calculated using laboratory power draw measurements, data on use patterns, common industry assumptions on product lifetimes, and LCA electricity emission factors from the 2022 Sphera LCA for Experts database. In our Environmental data tables , emissions \nfrom use of sold products are presented in “Other categories.”Category 12: “End-of-life treatment of sold products” includes GHG emissions associated with the end-of-life treatment of all of Google’s flagship consumer hardware products sold in 2022. End-of-life impact was calculated through our LCA process using emission factors from the 2022 Sphera LCA for Experts database. Our initial assessments identify this category to be one that doesn’t have significant life-cycle impact. We continue to develop programs to extend the life of our sold products and also to ensure efficient management of end-of-life materials.

We also made improvements to the quality of data used in estimating our emissions associated with manufacturing our data center hardware, as well as the LCAs and LCA emission factors used to calculate emissions related to data center construction. We didn’t recalculate prior year Scope 3 GHG emissions to reflect these changes.\nBiogenic emissions\nIn accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, biogenic emissions are reported separately from other Scope 1 GHG emissions. These CO\n2 emissions \nare generated from our operated vehicles consuming biofuels. Biogenic emissions are calculated using emission factors from the 2023 EPA Center for Corporate Climate Leadership GHG Emission Factors Hub.Emissions reductions and \ncompensations\nWe calculate our total operational emissions by summing \nScope 1, Scope 2 (market-based), Scope 3 (Category 6: Business travel), and Scope 3 (Category 7: Employee commuting, including teleworking), per the criteria described above. This market-based subtotal has been reduced by the impact of renewable energy procurement via PPAs and market-based emission factors. \nOur operational emissions are then further compensated \nfor by high-quality carbon credits enabled through contracted carbon offset projects, which capture and destroy highly potent GHGs. A carbon offset project is an activity that reduces GHG emissions or captures GHG emissions from the atmosphere, ultimately represented by a carbon credit. The carbon credit signifies that GHG emissions are lower than if no one had invested in the project. One carbon credit equals one metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent prevented from entering the atmosphere. We assess these projects against four standards before investing: additionality, leakage prevention, permanence, and verifiability. \nWe primarily enter into long-term purchase agreements \nwith carbon credit suppliers to secure future deliveries. Once carbon credits from a project under contract are verified by a third-party and issued by a carbon registry, per the agreement terms, ownership of the carbon credits is transferred from the project owner to Google. Our carbon credits are verified under the Climate Action Reserve (CAR), American Carbon Registry (ACR), Verified Carbon Standard (VCS), or the UNFCCC Clean Development Mechanism.   89\n2023 Environmental Report  All carbon credits are retired on a public registry after \nthey’re delivered to us.

They’re designed to be interchangeable globally and deliverable from a variety of project types. Refer to our Google’s Carbon Offsets: Collaboration and Due Diligence white paper for additional information. The quantity of carbon credits enabled through contracted projects is subject to the limited assurance procedures noted above; however, the quality of our projects and the related due diligence isn’t subject to the limited assurance procedures.\nOther carbon and \nenergy metrics\nOur carbon intensity metrics  are calculated as defined \nby GRI Disclosure 305-4a-c. Carbon intensity metrics are \nbased on gross global combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 (market-based) emissions. Reported carbon intensity per unit of revenue and per full-time equivalent (FTE) employee values are rounded to the nearest hundredth, and reported carbon intensity per MWh of energy consumed values are rounded to the nearest ten thousandth.\nTotal energy consumption  is calculated as defined \nby GRI Disclosure 302-1e-f. Total energy consumption \nincludes all fuel and natural gas consumption, purchased electricity, purchased heating, and all electricity generated on-site from renewable sources. Total electricity consumption is calculated as defined by GRI Disclosure 302-1c(i) and 302-1f, and includes both purchased and self-generated electricity. Where actual electricity consumption for facilities isn’t available, we estimate consumption using company square footage and internally developed electricity intensity factors based on fiscal year 2022 data.\nElectricity purchased from renewable sources (%) is \ncalculated on a calendar-year basis, dividing the volume of renewable electricity (in megawatt-hours) procured for our global operations (i.e., renewable energy procured through our PPA contracts, on-site renewable energy generation, and renewable energy in the electric grids where our facilities are located) by the total volume of electricity consumed by our global operations. This metric includes all renewable energy purchased, regardless of the market in which the renewable energy was consumed.\nGoogle currently purchases enough renewable energy  \nto match our annual global electricity consumption.  \nTo achieve our 100% renewable energy match  goal, \nwe first consider both our on-site renewable energy generation and the renewable energy that’s already in the electric",

We have a few facilities located in geographies where we’re not currently able to source large volumes of renewable energy, so we currently make up for this by buying surplus renewable energy in regions where it’s abundant. For example, by buying larger amounts of wind energy in places like Europe, we compensate for our lack of renewable energy purchases in Asia. This approach results in our Scope 2 market-based emissions being greater than zero, per the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Scope 2 Guidance, despite us achieving our 100% renewable energy match globally.Water metrics\nWe report all water metrics for Alphabet Inc. and its subsidiaries’ data centers, offices, and other assets under our operational control. “Water consumption”  is equal \nto (“Water withdrawal” – “Water discharge”). Our \nreported water consumption, water withdrawal, and water discharge metrics don’t include seawater. Water metrics are rounded to the nearest hundred thousand gallons and are reported in million gallons. \nWater withdrawal data is based on actual metered \nor invoiced data when it’s available. At offices where metered or invoiced data isn’t available, water withdrawal is estimated using facility square footage and internally developed water withdrawal intensity factors by office type based on fiscal year data. In all instances where actual potable water discharge isn’t available, we apply a 90% discharge flow factor to the facility water withdrawal to estimate water discharge. For irrigation water, we apply a 0% discharge flow factor to the facility water withdrawal to estimate water discharge. This estimation process is applicable to all offices and to potable and irrigation water withdrawal at data centers used for domestic purposes (i.e., water not used for IT cooling) where actual discharge isn’t available.Forward-looking \ninformation\nReferences to information in this report should not be \nconstrued as a characterization regarding the materiality of such information to our financial results or our operations.

We’ve formally \nexpressed support  for the TCFD reporting framework and its seven principles for climate disclosure, and we believe that our voluntary disclosures on climate-related matters are consistent with the recommendations of the TCFD framework. \nEvery year since 2009, we’ve publicly reported our \ncarbon footprint to CDP  (formerly known as the \nCarbon Disclosure Project). Since 2014, Alphabet has been included on CDP’s Climate Change A-list eight times, demonstrating our continued commitment to transparency and climate reporting. For our most recent CDP Climate Change Response, see our sustainability reports  page. \nClimate transition plan\nIn this report, we’ve outlined elements of our climate transition plan that will help us make progress toward our net-zero ambitions.

We identify the route that we predict will consume the least amount of fuel or energy. If this route isn’t already the fastest one and it offers meaningful energy and fuel savings with only a small increase in driving time, we recommend it to the user. To calculate enabled emissions reductions, we tally the fuel usage from the chosen fuel-efficient routes and subtract it from the predicted fuel consumption that would have occurred on the fastest route without eco-friendly routing and apply adjustments for factors such as: CO\n2e factors, fleet factors, well-to-wheels \nfactors, and powertrain mismatch factors. We then input the estimated prevented emissions into the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator  to calculate equivalent cars off the road for a year. The ",

Enabled emissions reductions estimates include inherent uncertainty due to factors that include the lack of primary data and precise information about real-world actions and their effects. These factors contribute to a range of possible outcomes, within which we report a central value.\n4 This estimated spend is based on contracts signed to purchase clean \nenergy for our operations. Actual spend may vary from these estimates based on changes in renewable electricity output from operational projects, the number of contracts signed, and energy market prices.\n5 See endnote 3 above.\n6 Estimated energy savings are calculated based on the typical percentage \nof heating and cooling savings found in real-world studies of the Nest Learning Thermostat. To calculate the total Nest savings, we apply these savings percentages to the actual heating and cooling hours of all Nest thermostats.\n7 “Portugal - Countries & Regions ,” IEA, 2021. \n8 The enabled emissions reductions are calculated based on these energy \nsavings, applying standard emission factors for fossil fuels, and using U.S. EPA AVERT marginal emissions for the 95% of electricity savings that occur in the U.S., with an adjusted value for the 5% of electricity savings outside the U.S.\n9 For products launched in 2022: Pixel, Nest, and Chromecast devices are \nmade with recycled materials ranging between 9% and 60% based on respective product weights.\n10\n Unique, signed-in Google users that were provided information to make a \nmore sustainable choice by at least one sustainable product feature.\n11 Due to a methodology change, we’re not reporting a percent progress \ntowards this target and have instead provided our total GHG emissions (Scope 1, 2 (market-based), and 3) in 2022.\n12\n In 2022, we expanded our carbon-free energy reporting from only \nGoogle-owned and -operated data centers to also incorporate offices and third-party data centers.

Sustainable biomass and carbon capture and storage (CCS) are special cases considered on a case-by-case basis, but are often also considered carbon-free energy sources.\n84\n Alphabet’s renewable energy methodology is a custom calculation and is \nbased on a global approach. Percentage of renewable energy is calculated on a calendar-year basis, dividing the volume of renewable electricity (in megawatt-hours) procured for our global operations (i.e., renewable energy procured through our PPA contracts, on-site renewable energy generation, and renewable energy in the electric grids where our facilities are located) by the total volume of electricity consumed by our global operations. The numerator includes all renewable energy procured, regardless of the market in which the renewable energy was consumed. Additional details on Alphabet’s criteria and methodology can be found in  the “ Achieving Our 100% Renewable Energy Purchasing Goal and Going \nBeyond ” disclosure.\n85\n For example, research by Princeton University  and TU Berlin has shown that \nhourly (24/7) carbon-free energy goals have a greater impact on grid-level decarbonization than the prevailing approach of 100% annual renewable energy matching.\n86\n See endnote 4 above.\n87 See endnote 4 above.\n88 “Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator ,” EPA, accessed 2022.\n89 Our CFE percentage measures the degree to which our electricity \nconsumption on a given regional grid is matched with CFE on an hourly basis.

CFE coming from the overall grid mix is based on data obtained from a third party, Electricity Maps, and has not been assured. For more information, see",

In the United States, this generally means the ISO or RTO in regions that have these regional    102\n2023 Environmental Report  market structures. If no such structure exists, then Google defines the grid \nregion as the electricity-balancing authority where our data centers are located. Outside of the United States, the grid region most often refers to the geographic boundary of a country, because most grid system operators operate at the national level. Certain regions that span multiple countries are well interconnected and could be considered as one grid; however, our grid mix calculations already include import and export considerations and therefore take into account power flows from neighboring grids. In the future, we may update our definition as we work with grid operators to better understand how transmission constraints or congestion impact CFE measurement within and across grid regions.\n91\n Contracted CFE is the hourly electricity production from clean energy \nprojects whose electricity and associated environmental attributes are contracted to Google via power purchase agreements, retail energy supply arrangements, or other contractual structures.

According to Google’s own analysis of our more efficient servers, power infrastructure, and cooling systems, compared with data center industry averages.\n2. PUE is a standard industry ratio that compares the amount of non-computing overhead energy (used for things like cooling and power distribution) to the amount of energy used to \npower IT equipment. A PUE of 2.0 means that for every watt of IT power, an additional watt is consumed to cool and distribute power to the IT equipment. A PUE closer to 1.0 means \nnearly all the energy is used for computing.\n3. According to the Uptime Institute’s 2020 Data Center Survey , the global average PUE of respondents’ largest data centers was around 1.59.\n4. Carbon credits are reductions in GHG emissions made to compensate for emissions that occur elsewhere. For each metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent reduced, one carbon credit \nis created. References to “carbon offsets” (as mentioned in prior reports) have been updated to “carbon credits” in Google’s 2021 Environmental Report.\n5. We procure high-quality carbon credits to compensate for the carbon emissions from all Google-owned shipments of consumer hardware, including to and from retail partners, \ndistributors, and Google Store customers. Because shipping devices to customers falls outside the scope of Google’s operations, these efforts go beyond Google’s long-standing \ncommitment to operational carbon neutrality.\n6.

Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions from other sources in our \nvalue chain, such as business travel or our suppliers.\n21. CO2e is a quantity that describes, for a given mixture and amount of GHG, the amount of carbon dioxide that would have the same global warming potential (GWP), i.e., the ability  \nof a gas to trap heat in the atmosphere when measured over a specified timescale (generally, 100 years). Some GHGs are more potent than others, as measured by their GWP.  \nCarbon dioxide is the baseline and thus has a GWP of 1.\n22. Since 2010, we’ve procured renewable energy for our operations, and in 2012, we began publishing how this reduces our overall emissions. Until 2015, there was no guidance from the \nGreenhouse Gas Protocol on how to account for these emissions reductions, so we developed our own methodology, whereby on an annual basis we assigned renewable electricity \nprocured against electricity consumed (in megawatt-hours) in the closest data center to the renewable energy project. In 2015, the Greenhouse Gas Protocol released new Scope 2 \nguidance for the accounting of purchased electricity, steam, heat, and cooling, which we adopted, starting with 2015 data. Our pre-2015 methodology differed from the Greenhouse \nGas Protocol’s in that we did not use residual mixes, which avoid double-counting of claimed renewable energy attributes.\n23. See note 19 above.\n24. In 2018, to align with industry best practices for Scope 3 reporting, we extended our reporting boundaries to include emissions associated with food served in our offices, hardware \nmanufacturing emissions beyond Tier 1 suppliers (full upstream to the point of extraction), use of sold products, and end-of-life treatment of sold products. Google’s hardware includes \ndata center servers, networking equipment, and consumer hardware products. These extended categories have been reported annually from 2018 onward.\n25. We’ve restated our 2018 Scope 3 (other) emissions due to changes in our calculation methodology and improvements in data quality, resulting in a corresponding restatement of our \n2018 Scope 3 (total) and 2018 Total (Scope 1, 2 [market-based], and 3 [total]) emissions.\n26.

We applied the estimation \nmethodology outlined in EcoAct’s Homeworking Emissions Whitepaper  to our annual average workforce in 2020 to estimate the GHG emissions generated by employees working \nremotely from their homes. Teleworking emissions are reported as part of our Scope 3 emissions for employee commuting, per Greenhouse Gas Protocol’s Technical Guidance for \nCalculating Scope 3 Emissions (version 1.0). For a breakdown of our operational Scope 3 emissions by category, see our 2020 Independent Accountants’ Review Report .\n27. In 2020, we began reporting teleworking emissions as part of our Scope 3 employee commuting emissions. Scope 3 (business travel and employee commuting) emissions reported \nprior to 2019 do not include teleworking emissions.\n28. See note 25 above.\n13\nGoogle Environmental Report 202129. See note 24 above. \n30. See note 25 above.\n31. We calculate total operational emissions as the sum of Scope 1, Scope 2 (location-based or market-based), and Scope 3 (business travel and employee commuting, including \nteleworking) emissions, which have been third-party assured by Ernst & Young LLP as shown in its 2020 Independent Accountants’ Review Report .\n32. See note 27 above.\n33. In 2016, we adopted the industry practice of including only operational emissions in our carbon neutrality commitment. For more information, see our 2017 white paper,  \n10 Years of Carbon Neutrality . In 2020, we extended our operational emissions boundary to include teleworking emissions. The operational emissions included in our carbon  \nneutrality commitment now include Scope 1, Scope 2 (market-based), and Scope 3 (business travel and employee commuting, including teleworking).\n34.

Total energy consumption includes all fuel and natural gas consumption, purchased electricity, purchased heating, and all electricity generated on-site from renewable and  \nnon-renewable sources.\n39. Percentage of renewable energy is calculated on a calendar-year basis, comparing the volume of renewable electricity (in megawatt-hours) procured for our global operations  \n(i.e., renewable energy procured through our PPA contracts, on-site renewable energy generation, and renewable energy in the electric grids where our facilities are located) with the \ntotal volume of electricity consumed by our operations. This metric includes all renewable energy purchased, regardless of the market in which the renewable energy was consumed. \nPrior to 2016, we were not accounting for the renewable electricity purchased through grid electricity.\n40. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol’s Scope 2 Guidance  requires energy attribute certificates to be sourced from and applied to the same market in which the reporting entity’s electricity-\nconsuming operations are located. This guidance does not recognize existing renewable energy on the electric grids where an entity’s operations are located.\n41. Our carbon-free energy (CFE) percentage measures the degree to which our electricity consumption on a given regional grid is matched with CFE on an hourly basis. This is calculated using \nboth CFE under contract by Google as well as CFE coming from the overall grid mix. For more information, see our 2021 white paper, 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy: Methodologies and Metrics .\n42. We’ve revised total waste generated for 2019 due to a calculation error. This correction resulted in a decrease in total waste generated for 2019 from 51,617 metric tons to 48,216 metric tons.\n43. Landfill diversion is calculated as waste diverted to a more sustainable pathway than landfill or incineration without energy recovery.\n44. In 2020, pre-consumer food waste prevented in our cafés was tracked only from January to March due to limited café operations during the global pandemic.\n45. In 2019, we aligned our water reporting with industry standards to disclose three water indicators: total water withdrawal, as well as consumption and discharge.\n46.

This exceeds our 2025 target of a 20% emissions reduction although our operational emissions are expected to fluctuate as more new projects come online. While this adds to the challenge of reducing emissions, our work to do so continues.\n yOn n\net zero sales  (aim 3) – our target for 2025 \nis a 5% reduction in carbon intensity and we have now reached 3% compared with 2019. \n yOn r\neducing methane (aim 4) – our first goal was \nto deploy our methane measurement approach across our operated upstream oil and gas assets by the end of 2023. We are very proud to say that we have completed this. Our methane intensity\n in 2023 remained at 0.05%, based \non our existing methodology. As we look ahead, we'll take stock of our aim 4 targets as we embed our new measurement approach.In terms of strategic progress, 2023 was a year of continued delivery. Though today we remain mostly in oil and gas, one example of the investment we are making as we transform bp is our purchase of TravelCenters of America. The investment means that we are now on almost every major US highway, with a network of around 290 sites\na that allows us to develop our \nconvenience business alongside biofuels, biogas, EV charging and, in time, hydrogen.

Through the EITI Standard, countries are encouraged to make disclosures relating to tax, revenues, contracts and licences linked to the extractive industries. This is intended to improve understanding of the economic contribution of the extractive industries and mitigate corruption risks.\nWe are a founding member of the EITI and sit on \nits board, which sets priorities for the organization and evaluates countries’ progress in meeting the EITI Standard. We also actively participate in national multi-stakeholder groups in Trinidad and Tobago, Mauritania and Senegal. In 2023 EITI awarded Trinidad and Tobago a high overall score (89 out of 100) for meeting the requirements of the EITI Standard. The significant efforts of the multi-stakeholder group the contributed to this strong performance. \nWe support the EITI’s initiative to encourage \nbeneficial ownership transparency globally and we use beneficial ownership information in a risk-based manner when conducting due diligence on our counterparties\na.\nWe also back governments’ efforts to encourage and promote contract transparency when appropriate because we recognize its importance in improving understanding of our industry, promoting accountability and building trust. We contribute to the public disclosure of contracts and licences consistent with government procedures in EITI-implementing countries where we have a presence.Political donationsWe prohibit the use of bp funds or resources to support any political candidate or party. We recognize the rights of our employees to participate in political processes and these rights are governed by the applicable laws in the countries where we operate. Our stance on political activity is set out in our code. \nIn the US we provide administrative support for \nthe bp employee political action committee (PAC) – a non-partisan, employee-led committee that encourages voluntary employee participation in the political process. All contributions made by the bp employee PAC are weighed against the PAC’s criteria for candidate support and reviewed for legal compliance before funds are sent to the recipients, and publicly reported in accordance with US election laws. Contributions made by the PAC are from employee contributions and not from bp funds.\nTax",

We comply with the tax legislation of the countries where we operate, and do not tolerate the facilitation of tax evasion by people who act for or on behalf of bp.In 2023 we continued to pay higher rates of tax due to windfall taxes on energy producers and suppliers.

To implement these \ncapability plans, we are developing our current talent by running targeted skills development campaigns, while also recruiting externally to bring new expertise into bp. This is helping us build a workforce with the skills we need as our business evolves.\nOur culture\nWe use data from various sources, including our ‘Pulse annual’ employee survey, to provide insights about our culture. This data is regularly reviewed by bp leadership with oversight and assurance provided by the board and its committees. \nIn 2023 we established a board-level ‘Who we \nare’ culture oversight committee to gain insight into our progress towards embedding the ‘Who we are’ culture frame, with a specific emphasis on psychological safety and speaking up.

It guides our approach to recruitment, assessment, development, performance management and reward.\nIn 2023 we further embedded ‘Who we are’ by \ncontinuing to integrate it into our policies and practices, including our hiring approach and interview tools. We trained a community of more than 2,000 ‘Who we are’ changemakers and piloted behaviour change initiatives to bring our beliefs to life. Our 2023 ‘Pulse annual’ survey showed that around 80% of employees see our beliefs reflected in our actions.\nbp.com /whoweare\nMonitoring employee sentimentWe measure employee sentiment through our ‘Pulse annual’ survey, which is sent to all eligible employees, and through our ‘Pulse live’ survey, which is sent weekly to a representative sample of around 8% of employees. To supplement our annual survey feedback, we discuss specific topics in listening panels and focus groups. \nIn 2023 we extended the ‘Pulse annual’ survey to \ncover a subset of our retail employees, to provide a more complete and representative view of our total workforce. This will be increasingly important as we grow our retail and convenience businesses.Employee engagementResults from the 2023 ‘Pulse annual’ survey, which ran in August and September 2023, showed that pride in working for bp increased from 78% reported in 2022 and reached a record 80%.

The scenarios set out in this document explore some of the possible pathways that the energy transition could take up to 2050 and help to inform our key beliefs about it. These beliefs include the following:\n yTh\ne carbon budget is running out. Despite the \nmarked increase in government ambitions, carbon dioxide emissions have increased every year since the Paris COP in 2015 (except for 2020).\n yTh\ne disruption to global energy supplies and \nassociated energy shortages caused by the Russia-Ukraine war increased the importance attached to addressing the issues of energy security and affordability. yThe structure of energy demand will continue t\no change, with fossil fuels declining and being \nreplaced by a growing share of renewable energy and by increasing electrification.\n yTh\ne transition to a low carbon world requires a \nrange of other energy sources and technologies, including low carbon hydrogen, modern bioenergy and carbon capture, use and storage.\nbp.com/energyoutlook\nOur net zero targets and aims\nWe believe our ambition and aims, taken together, are consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement.

We see the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as the most authoritative source of information on the science of climate change and we use it and other sources to inform our strategy. The IPCC highlights that there are a range of global pathways by which the world can meet the Paris goals, with differing implications for regions, industry sectors and sources of energy.\nThe bp Energy Outlook 2023 updated the 2022 \nOutlook to reflect the significant developments in global energy markets during the preceding year, including the possible impact of the Russia-Ukraine war on the pace of the energy transition.

In addition (within the inevitable constraints associated with factors such as long-term capital investments, contractual commitments and organizational capabilities at any given time) bp’s ability to maintain its strategic resilience rests, in part, on the governance used to keep the strategy under review in light of new information and changes in circumstances.3 Contributes to net zero\nWe believe our strategy enables us to make \na positive contribution to the world achieving net \nzero GHG emissions and meeting the Paris goals – outcomes we believe to be in our best interests as well as beneficial to society generally. We see huge opportunity in the energy transition – the transformation of the energy system that we believe to be a necessary feature of the world’s efforts to meet the Paris goals.\nIn addition to investing in and scaling our own \nlower carbon businesses there are many ways a company at the heart of the energy sector can make a meaningful contribution to the world getting to net zero. These include: policy advocacy and seeking to use our influence with trade associations that conduct climate-related advocacy; low carbon collaboration and support for others in their own decarbonization efforts (such as cities and corporates); and making venturing investments in promising new businesses and technologies that have the potential to contribute to the energy transition.

These reviews consider the quantity and quality of water used as well as any applicable regulatory requirements.\nIn 2022 we reviewed the internal standards, \npractices and guidance that underpin our water activities. Based on this review, we updated them in 2023 to align them with our sustainability frame. We track and monitor evolving external water frameworks so that we can continue to refine our water stewardship practices as these frameworks develop. \nOur water consumption in 2023\nWe saw a 29% fall in freshwater withdrawals and a 15% fall in freshwater consumption, compared with our 2020 baseline\na. Reductions in 2023 were largely \ndue to the divestment of Toledo Refinery, however other changes were attributable to the reconfiguration of Kwinana refinery, turnaround activity at Castellón refinery and use of non-freshwater sources in bpx energy Eagle Ford. This was partially offset by increases in consumption at Cherry Point owing to the introduction of the new hydrocracker and cooling water infrastructure projects and an increase in drilling and completions activity at some of our bpx energy operations. \nWe actively manage our freshwater demands in \nareas of stress and scarcity. Taking into account analysis that utilized the World Resources Institute (WRI) Aqueduct Global Water Risk Atlas, in 2023 eight of our 17 major operating sites were located in regions with medium to extremely high water stress (2022 five). Based on anticipated changes in the areas WRI identifies as water stressed, this number is expected to remain largely unchanged by 2030, assuming a business as-usual scenario with no portfolio changes.At major operating sites, 73% of our total freshwater withdrawals and 36% of freshwater consumption were from regions with high or extremely high water stress in 2023.

As a result, three of our refineries are located in regions that are now considered to have higher water stress.\nOur wastewater treatment concentrations \ndecreased slightly owing to lower discharge volumes at the refineries. The average chemical oxygen demand concentration of the treated water discharged from bp-operated treatment facilities to the freshwater environment was 40mg/l.\nbp.com/ESGdata\nImproving water efficiency\nIn 2023 we continued detailed, site-based water assessments at four refineries – Rotterdam in the Netherlands, Lingen in Germany and Cherry Point and Whiting in the US – representing approximately 51% of our total consumption in 2023. Our assessments help identify areas where we can create operational efficiencies in water consumption. \nAt our Lingen refinery, a water recycling project \nwent into operation. A new water treatment system recycles wastewater from the refinery and reuses it for industrial processes. The volume of treated water is equivalent to approximately 500,000m\n3 per annum of fresh water saved. \nAt our bpx energy facilities in the US, produced water is used instead of fresh water to commission operations at some of the wells.

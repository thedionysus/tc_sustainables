So we set an even more ambitious \\ngoal  — to make our products carbon neutral by 2030, across our entire \\nsupply chain and the lifetime energy use of our customers’ devices. \\nTeams across Apple quickly got to work, and thanks to their innovations, \\nwe’ve made extraordinary  progress.\\nIn this year’s report, you’ll find the most detailed portrait yet of where we \\nare today and where we’re headed. Here’s the big picture: Since 2015, \\nwe’ve reduced our emissions by over 45 percent . We did it while reaching \\nmore Apple users than ever before. And, in doing so, we demonstrated \\nthat the choice between a thriving business and a thriving planet is a \\nfalse  one.\\nThis was also the year we called on our suppliers to accelerate their \\nwork to address their emissions. We’ve sent a clear message that the \\ncompanies who manufacture our products must decarbonize their entire \\nApple footprint by 2030, including the use of 100 percent  renewable \\nelectricity. And today, over 250 of our suppliers  — accounting for over \\n85 percent  of Apple’s direct manufacturing spend  — are a part of our \\nSupplier Clean Energy  Program.\\nWe share our progress  — and our goals  — because transparency and \\naccountability are two sides of the same coin. We do the work and we \\nshow our work, because we want to be the ripple in the pond that creates \\na broader  change.\\nThis year, we’ve also made it easier to understand the carbon impact of \\nyour Apple devices, and the extraordinary steps we’re taking to reduce \\ntheir emissions. In our Product Environment Reports, you can learn about \\nrecycled gold in your iPhone, the energy demands of your iPad, and the packaging around your Mac. We’re transforming so many aspects of the \\nway we make our technology, and with our Product Environment Reports, \\nyou’ll see where we’ve made progress and where the hard work  remains.\\nOne thing is clear: We’re closer than ever to the day you can hold your \\nApple device and be confident in the knowledge that it has net-zero \\ncarbon impact. There are few companies that can make that claim  — let \\nalone ones that set our high standards and transparently show their \\nprogress along the way.\\nAs we move closer to our goals, we’ve continued to push the pace by \\nbringing new clean energy online to power our supply chain. And we’re \\ninvesting in a growing number of renewable energy projects to balance \\nthe electricity our customers use to charge their  devices.\\nRecycled materials are also a key focus of our innovations, and another \\nway we’re driving down our emissions. Today, about 20 percent  of the \\nmaterials in our products are from recycled or renewable sources. Our \\ngoal is to one day reach 100 percent , and to end our reliance on mining \\naltogether. Where we continue to extract materials, we maintain the \\nhighest standards in our due diligence and respect for human rights. And \\nwe’re accelerating our work with new goals to use 100 percent  recycled \\ncobalt, tin, gold, and rare earth elements in key components by 2025. \\nThe strides we’re making play a huge role in driving down our emissions \\neven further, reducing our reliance on energy-intensive mining, smelting, \\nand refining.\\nWe’ll keep pursuing creative ways to reduce our footprint, and only use \\nhigh-quality carbon offsets to balance emissions we can’t zero out. That’s \\nwhy we launched the Restore Fund, which aims to help businesses invest \\nin high-quality, nature-based solutions that restore the forests, wetlands, \\nand grasslands that remove carbon from our atmosphere.Equity remains a central focus of our investments in clean energy and \\ngreen technology. We continue to grow our Impact Accelerator, which \\ninvests in the next generation of innovative, diverse entrepreneurs in fields \\nlike clean energy, recycling, and green chemistry. We’ve also expanded \\nour Power for Impact program, which brings renewable projects to \\ncommunities around the world  — from neighborhoods in rural South \\nAfrica to underresourced schools in the Philippines. We believe the best \\nway to fight climate change is to engage communities on their front lines, \\nand every day, we put the action to those  words.\\nI’ve worn a few different hats over my career  — including as Administrator \\nof the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and leading this work at \\nApple. It’s taught me that tackling climate change is possible only when \\nwe bring government, industry, and communities together. We have to \\nmeet a global challenge with global solutions  — solutions that center \\non people.\\nI have so many talented, passionate colleagues who share in this mission. \\nThanks to their tireless work, we’ve hurdled barriers that once seemed \\nimpossible to clear. We have no illusions about the challenges ahead, but \\nwhatever comes, we’ll keep marching  forward.\\nApple is on a journey  — and we’ll share the road with as many people as \\nwe can. We hope you’ll join us.\\nLisa  JacksonLisa  Jackson  \\nVice President, Environment, \\nPolicy & Social  Initiatives\\n2023 Environmental Progress Report  3 Climate Change Resources Smarter Chemistry Engagement and Advocacy Appendix Introduction \\nReport \\nhighlights\\xa0\\nCarbon neutral for \\ncorporate  emissions\\nSince April 2020, we’ve achieved \\ncarbon neutrality for our \\ncorporate emissions1 by sourcing \\n100 percent  renewable electricity \\nfor Apple facilities, implementing \\nenergy efficiency, and securing \\nhigh-quality carbon offsets for \\nremaining emissions.\\xa0While \\ncorporate emissions\\xa0represent \\nonly a small portion of our overall \\nemissions, this is an important \\nstep toward our broader goal of \\nachieving carbon neutrality for all \\nour products.\\nRead more on page 13 .\\nReduced value chain \\nemissions by over \\n45 percent \\xa0\\nWe reduced our overall emissions \\nacross scopes 1, 2, and 32 by \\nover 45 percent  compared \\nwith our 2015 baseline year. \\nWe avoided\\xa0over 28 million \\nmetric tons of emissions \\nthrough reduction initiatives like \\ntransitioning our supply chain to \\nrenewable electricity and sourcing \\nrecycled content for our products .\\nRead more on page 7 .Called on \\nApple suppliers \\nto decarbonize \\nIn October 2022, we urged \\nour worldwide supply chain \\nto decarbonize their entire \\nApple-related footprint\\xa0by \\n2030, including their scope 1 \\nand 2 emissions associated \\nwith Apple production.

Shifting  \\nweather patterns threaten the food  \\nwe eat. Widespread wildfires and  \\nflooding devastate the communities  \\nwe live in and the ecosystems  \\nwe depend on. These dangers  \\nare felt around the globe and are  \\ndeveloping at an unprecedented  \\npace. The stakes are fundamental:  \\nHuman rights like life, health, food,  \\nand an adequate standard of living  \\nface grave risks, disproportionately  \\naffecting low-income and historically  \\nmarginalized communities. The worst,  \\nand potentially irreversible, impacts  \\nof climate change can be prevented  \\nwith global, comprehensive, and  \\nimmediate  action.\\xa0As a large global company, we believe it’s our \\nresponsibility to take strong, decisive, and inclusive steps \\nto mitigate our impact on the climate. We’ve committed to \\nachieving carbon neutrality across our entire value chain \\nby 2030  — reducing emissions by 75 percent  compared \\nwith 2015 and balancing the residual emissions with \\nhigh-quality carbon removal.7 This means that our goal \\nto be carbon neutral also extends to all our products. This \\ngoal is more aggressive than the Intergovernmental Panel \\non Climate Change’s recommendation for global carbon \\nneutrality within 20 years.8\\nApple is also committed to working toward reaching a \\n90 percent  reduction in emissions from our 2015 baseline \\nby 2050. Attaining this deep decarbonization target will \\nrequire a different focus and a collective, global effort. \\nEntire industries and economies must decarbonize. And \\nwhile reaching a 90 percent  reduction in emissions is \\noutside Apple’s or any one company’s control, Apple is \\ncommitted to supporting action as part of this global shift: \\nto push for better policies, invest in new technological \\ninnovations, and engage in new and expanded \\npartnerships, both public and private.\\nOur goals are ambitious  — and they come with many \\nchallenges. But we’ve already made progress by cutting \\nemissions across our value chain by over 45 percent  \\nsince  2015.We began by making the transition to sourcing \\n100 percent  renewable electricity at our offices, retail \\nstores, and data centers, which we achieved in 2018. \\nAnd in 2020, we achieved carbon neutrality for our \\ncorporate emissions.9\\nOur philosophy for achieving carbon neutrality follows \\nthese  principles:\\nCalculate our footprint across our value chain:  Our \\nresponsibility extends beyond our direct operations to \\nour product-related emissions. That’s why we model our \\nemissions across the entire life cycle of our products  — \\nincluding the sourcing of raw materials, manufacturing, \\nshipping, product use, and end-of-life processing.10 \\nWe\\xa0use the results of our detailed carbon accounting to \\nadjust our 2030 Climate Roadmap, which lays out our \\nplan to become carbon  neutral.\\nSet ambitious targets:  Our plan to reach carbon \\nneutrality by 2030 centers around our strategy to reduce \\nemissions by 75 percent , relative to our 2015 carbon \\nfootprint. This reduction aligns with what current climate \\nscience shows is necessary to limit warming to 1.5°\\xa0C.11 \\nWe plan to invest in high-quality carbon removal projects \\nto address the remaining emissions, prioritizing nature-\\nbased solutions. And by focusing on emissions reduction, \\nwe’re tackling the transformative work of making \\nlow-carbon  products.Match solutions to sources:  For each activity within our \\nvalue chain, we seek out decarbonization actions that tie \\nto the source of those emissions. For example, we’ll look \\nto reduce emissions from electricity by using renewable \\nor low-carbon electricity and decrease emissions from \\ntransportation by using alternative fuels and lower-\\ncarbon modes of transport. By matching solutions to \\ncarbon sources, we’ll do our part to help decarbonize \\nthe economy.\\nMake environmental progress good for our business:  \\nWe’re proving every day that there doesn’t need to be a \\ntrade-off between what’s good for the planet and what’s \\ngood for business. This means that we seek out climate \\nsolutions that are cost competitive, offer a financial return, \\nbenefit our customers, or achieve more than one of these \\noutcomes. For example, we’re working with investment \\nmanagers who are creating investment funds for clean \\nenergy and nature-based carbon removal solutions, \\nwhich aim to deliver both environmental benefits and \\nfinancial returns. And when we design products to be \\nenergy efficient and use recycled content, we view these \\nas product features that add value for our customers. By \\nunderpinning our climate strategy with strong business \\nprinciples and innovation, we aim to harness the power \\nof markets to replicate our solutions at scale, creating the \\nimpact necessary to meet global reduction  targets.Our approach\\n$4.7B\\nWe’ve issued $4. 7 billion  \\nin green bonds to model  \\nhow businesses can drive  \\ninvestments to reduce  \\nglobal emissions.

This \\nincludes facilitating the development of new technologies, \\nlike direct carbon-free aluminum smelting, adopting novel \\nfinancial approaches such as the Apple Restore Fund, \\nadvancing policies that support a low-carbon economy, \\nand continuing to invest in research and development to \\nenable decarbonizing our products by 2030.\\nBe open:  We’re committed to disclosing our carbon \\nfootprint as well as\\xa0our climate strategy and progress. \\nBy sharing our approach, we aim to send clear signals to \\nothers and invite them to work with us. We also hope to \\nempower our peers in their pursuit of carbon neutrality \\nand engage investors through financing options, such as \\ngreen bonds. This means sharing both challenges and \\nsuccesses. Our annual Environmental Progress Reports, \\nas well as our response to the global disclosure nonprofit \\nCDP, provide details on our progress.Support underrepresented communities:  Low-income \\nand historically marginalized communities too often \\nbear the brunt of the effects of climate change. So we’re \\npursuing ways to directly support these communities \\nin our climate program  — like with the Apple Impact \\nAccelerator, which aims to bolster equity and foster \\nopportunity for Black-, Hispanic/Latinx-, and Indigenous-\\nowned businesses in the environmental sector. We’re \\nadvocating for greater access to clean energy, and we’re \\ninvesting in renewable energy projects in emerging \\nmarkets.

In 2022, we expanded \\nthe scope 3 emissions we include in our corporate \\nfootprint and are now also carbon neutral for work from \\nhome, third-party cloud services, electricity transmission \\nand distribution losses, and upstream impacts from \\nscope 1  fuels.  To reach neutrality, we focused on driving \\nenergy efficiency improvements and transitioning our \\nfacilities to 100 percent  renewable electricity, which we \\nachieved in 2018. These programs have reduced our \\nscope 1  and scope 2  emissions by 67 percent  since 2011, \\nwhen we first began procuring renewable electricity, even \\nas our business grew. We’ve addressed the remaining scope 1 , 2, and 3 emissions (for a total of 324, 100 metric \\ntons) by securing high-quality carbon credits from \\nprojects that protect and restore forests, wetlands, \\nand grasslands.\\nMeasuring our footprint\\nWe account for our carbon footprint by following \\ninternationally recognized standards, like the World \\nResources Institute (WRI) Greenhouse Gas Protocol \\nand ISO 14040/14044. For our corporate footprint, we \\ncalculate emissions based on consumption data when \\navailable; when it’s not available, we rely on reasonable \\nassumptions and methodologies to estimate emissions, \\nwhich we revisit and improve on regularly. For our product \\nhardware carbon footprint, we use a life cycle–based \\napproach.

Improving the \\naccuracy of our carbon footprint is an ongoing process  — \\nas we learn more, we refine our carbon models and \\nadjust our climate road map. We also regularly revisit the \\nboundary of our footprint to best reflect our impact. For \\nexample, in 2022, we expanded our corporate footprint \\nto include work from home emissions, third-party cloud \\nservices, electricity transmission and distribution losses, \\nand upstream impacts from scope 1  fuels. \\nEvaluating climate  risks\\nIn 2020, we conducted a climate scenario analysis to \\nhelp us better understand the potential physical and transition effects of climate change. To align with the \\nT ask Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures \\n(TCFD) recommendations, we considered a range \\nof future scenarios, including a scenario below 2° C. \\nOur assessment had a global scope to capture all our \\ncorporate facilities  — including offices, retail locations, \\nand data centers  — as well as 200 supplier facilities, \\nbased on spend. The analysis highlighted how our \\nrenewable energy program and carbon neutrality goals \\ncould contribute to our corporate resilience. It also \\nprovided environmental data that we considered when \\ndeveloping business strategies, including around supply \\nchain diversification, and when safeguarding our global \\nassets. The results of the scenario analysis contributed to \\na larger body of internal assessments on the physical and \\ntransition impacts of climate change on our business.\\ncarbon neutral  \\nfor our corporate  \\noperations\\n* We’ve reduced corporate\\xa0emissions through energy efficiency, renewable electricity, and low-carbon fuels, and we’re applying carbon offsets to the remaining emissions.(having already reduced scope 1 and 2 emissions by 67% since 2011*)2023 Environmental Progress Report  13 Resources Smarter Chemistry Engagement and Advocacy Appendix Introduction Climate Change\\nEach Apple product represents an \\nopportunity to reduce our carbon \\nfootprint  — even small changes \\ncan yield significant results. Our \\ncarbon footprint helps us identify \\nopportunities to reduce the carbon \\nintensity of our product designs. \\nWe prioritize the materials and \\ncomponents that account for \\nsignificant portions of our carbon \\nemissions. This means\\xa0that the \\nchoices we make product by product \\ncan scale toward reducing our overall \\nfootprint. These priorities inform our \\nwork to design for material efficiency \\nand increased use of recycled and \\nrenewable  materials.Improving material and \\nmanufacturing  efficiency \\nLess means more when it comes to our approach \\nto materials and how we process them. Making our \\nmanufacturing processes more efficient creates less \\nwaste and helps us make the most of the materials we \\nsource. We’re also working to design our products so that \\nthey require less material in the first place. Combined, \\nthese efforts help reduce emissions from transporting \\nand processing materials. And as we progress toward our \\n2030 carbon neutrality goal, we continue to investigate \\nnew materials and new ways to manufacture  efficiently. \\nWe’ve continued to improve the carbon efficiency of \\nthe integrated circuits that we use in our products  — \\ncomponents we’ve prioritized because they’re carbon-\\nintensive. Integrated circuits perform vital functions \\nin electronic devices but require significant energy \\nto manufacture. We also continued our work with \\nthe\\xa0sustainable semiconductor technologies and systems \\nresearch program of imec, a world-leading research \\nand innovation hub in nanoelectronics and digital \\ntechnologies, of which we were the first public company \\nto join in October 2021. Our goal in collaborating is \\ntwofold: to improve the data associated with integrated \\ncircuit production, from end to end, and to use improved \\ndata and shared expertise to identify carbon reduction \\nopportunities for the entire integrated circuits industry. Low-carbon design\\nAnd we keep investigating new opportunities for \\nimproved efficiency across our product manufacturing \\nprocesses. In 2022, we continued to invest in research \\nand development projects aimed at: creating less waste \\nin processing materials, reducing machining time and \\nassociated energy use, more efficiently transforming \\nmaterial into the shapes we need, and maximizing \\nrecovery and reprocessing of manufacturing scrap. Once \\nthese improved processes are successfully developed, \\nwe plan to work with our suppliers as they deploy them at \\nscale at our supplier  facilities.\\nUsing recycled materials to lower \\nour product carbon  footprint\\xa0\\nMaterials selection is another way to reduce the carbon \\nfootprint of our products. Our strategy is to transition to \\nmaterials manufactured using low-carbon energy and \\nrecycled content. We’ve prioritized the materials and \\ncomponents that make up a large part of our product \\ncarbon footprint to move us closer to our goal of product \\ncarbon neutrality. And to accelerate collective efforts, \\nwe signed on to the First Movers Coalition’s near-zero \\nemissions primary aluminum commitment for 2030 \\n(see\\xa0more on  page  26).\\nUndertaking a comprehensive life cycle analysis for the materials and components \\nin our products led us to prioritizing low-carbon aluminum.

Read more \\nabout how we plan to \\naddress emissions from our \\ncustomers’ use of Apple \\nproducts on page  24.Aluminum is a great example of Apple’s comprehensive \\napproach: We’re transitioning to recycled content, and \\nwhere we haven’t yet, we’re moving to low-carbon \\nsuppliers and technology innovations to further \\ndecarbonize. In 2015, aluminum represented over a \\nquarter of our product manufacturing footprint. Since \\nthen, we’ve continued to introduce 100 percent  recycled \\naluminum in the enclosures of Apple products: All iPad \\nmodels in our lineup use 100 percent  recycled aluminum \\nin their enclosures  — joining Apple Watch Series 8, \\nApple Watch SE, MacBook Air, Mac mini, and the 14-inch \\nand 16-inch MacBook Pro  computers. In addition, the \\nnew Studio Display contains a 100 percent  recycled \\naluminum stand, and the Mac Studio enclosure and Apple \\nTV thermal module both contain 80 percent  recycled \\naluminum. And with\\xa0iPhone 14, we’ve increased recycled \\ncontent by using recycled CNC chips with Apple’s \\nstrongest aluminum alloy for the first time.\\nFor products shipped in 2022 that had enclosures \\nmade with primary aluminum, we prioritized the use \\nof aluminum smelted using low-carbon sources of \\nelectricity rather than fossil fuels, for a lower carbon \\nimpact. We also shipped iPhone SE enclosures that \\ncontained ELYSIS aluminum, which was smelted without \\ngenerating greenhouse gas emissions (see page 26  for \\nmore  information). We also continue to make progress in how we source \\nrecycled aluminum. Our first priority is to recover any of \\nour own scrap at high quality. Then, to augment this, we \\nlook to other postindustrial and postconsumer sources for \\nhigh-quality recycled aluminum, which emits\\xa0less carbon \\nthan newly mined materials. And we’re expanding our \\nsourcing to include postconsumer recycled aluminum \\nfrom building and construction scrap that meets the high \\nstandards that our products require. These emissions \\nreduction efforts have reduced our aluminum-related \\nemissions by 71 percent  since 2015 and now represent \\nless than 8\\xa0percent of our product manufacturing \\nfootprint, compared with 27 percent  in 2015.\\nIn 2022, we began shipping products with certified \\nrecycled steel and expanded our use of certified recycled \\ngold  — two materials that typically have significant \\ncarbon footprints. We introduced certified recycled steel \\nfor the first time in the MacBook Air with M2 chip, which \\nhas 90 percent  recycled steel in the battery tray. And we \\nsignificantly expanded the use of certified recycled gold \\nin our products  — from the gold plating on the main logic \\nboard on iPhone to other product main logic boards and \\nflexible printed circuit boards  — increasing recycled gold \\ncontent from 1 percent  in 2021 to approximately 4 percent  \\nacross all product lines in 2022.iPad Mini\\niPad Pro (11-inch \\nanD 12.9-inch )All these products \\ncontain 100% recycled \\naluminum enclosures\\nMacBook AirMacBook Pro  \\n(14-inch and 16-inch)Apple Watch SEIPADiPad AirApple Watch \\nSERIES 8Mac mini2023 Environmental Progress Report  15 Resources Smarter Chemistry Engagement and Advocacy Appendix Introduction Climate Change\\nDriving product energy  efficiency \\nProduct energy use accounts for 24 percent  of our gross \\ncarbon footprint  — and it has an impact on the individual \\nenergy use of each of our customers. This is why we’ve \\nset aggressive targets to reduce our products’ energy \\nusage. We approach this challenge in the earliest phases \\nof design, taking a holistic view of each product  —\\xa0from \\nhow efficiently the software operates to the power \\nrequirements of individual  components. \\nWith each generation of products, we strive to improve \\nenergy efficiency. For example, the transition to Apple \\nsilicon on Mac devices continues to drive these \\nimprovements. The latest generation of our Pro chips is \\nenabling more Mac devices to run with improved energy \\nefficiency. For example, MacBook Pro  with M2 Pro and \\nM2 Max made significant progress in reducing energy \\nuse in 2022, and the new Apple TV 4K is designed to \\nminimize its impact on the environment, using nearly \\n30 percent  less power than the previous generation while achieving more powerful performance.13 The \\nefficiency gains of the A15 Bionic chip eliminate the \\nneed for an internal fan, resulting in a more compact \\ndesign and contributing to a 25 percent  reduction in \\ncarbon footprint over the previous generation. Through \\nour energy efficiency improvements, we’ve cut overall \\nproduct energy use across all major product lines by \\nmore than 70\\xa0percent since 2008.14\\xa0And Apple products \\nare consistently rated by ENERGY STAR, which sets \\nspecifications that reflect the 25 percent  most energy-\\nefficient devices on the market. In 2022, all eligible Apple \\nproducts received an ENERGY STAR rating for superior \\nenergy efficiency.15 They also met the requirements for \\nEPEAT registration,16 another environmental rating system \\nfor electronic products, which considers energy efficiency \\nand a number of other environmental  topics.Product energy  efficiency\\nApple TV 4K is designed \\nto use nearly 30 percent  \\nless power  than the \\nprevious generation \\nwhile achieving more \\npowerful performance.17Over the course of a year, \\nMac Studio uses up to \\n1000 kilowatt-hours \\nless energ y  than a high-\\nend PC desktop.18\\niPhone 14 uses \\n57 percent  less \\nenerg y  than the U.S. \\nDepartment of Energy’s \\nrequirements for battery \\ncharger systems.19\\n2023 Environmental Progress Report  16 Resources Smarter Chemistry Engagement and Advocacy Appendix Introduction Climate Change\\nOur energy efficiency goals extend \\nwell beyond our products. We’re \\nfocused on using less energy across \\nour operations, beginning with how \\nwe design, operate, and maintain \\nour facilities. And we continue these \\nsame efforts into our supply chain. \\nEnergy efficiency is also essential to \\nmeeting our 2030 carbon neutrality \\ngoal. So we track and monitor \\nenergy use across our operations \\nand supply chain, conducting audits \\nto find opportunities to work more \\nefficiently. And we view our energy \\nuse holistically, from the point of \\ndesign to the point of manufacture.Operating Apple \\nfacilities  efficiently\\nWhile our data centers, retail stores, and offices all use \\n100 percent  renewable electricity, we are focused on \\nreducing the energy we use in the first place. We consider \\nnatural gas and electricity usage at each of these types of \\nsites  — as well as research and development facilities  — \\nauditing how we perform and, when needed, using \\nbest practices for energy management to reduce our \\nloads. And we tailor the design of new buildings to our \\noccupants’ and lab users’ specific needs. This approach \\nhelps us use our facilities efficiently and productively.\\nExisting buildings: There are significant opportunities to \\nsave energy in retrocommissioning buildings that Apple \\nalready occupies or operates, including energy-intensive \\nfacilities like data centers. We audit the performance of \\nbuildings around the world, and then deploy identified \\nreduction measures. Retrocommissioning focuses on \\nbuilding controls to\\xa0emphasize energy use reduction and \\noperational efficiency. We are prioritizing reducing natural \\ngas usage and replacing natural gas equipment with \\nelectrical equipment. While we’ve already transitioned to \\nrenewable electricity for our facilities, minimizing natural \\ngas is also an important element of working toward \\ndecarbonization. We are focused on reviewing and \\nbenchmarking our most natural gas–intensive buildings to \\nlook for reduction and fuel switching  opportunities. \\nData centers:\\xa0 Data centers are traditionally energy-\\nintensive, requiring significant resources to cool the heat-\\ngenerating equipment. That’s why we’re continuously \\nmonitoring and improving upon the controls for our Energy efficiency\\ncooling systems. This retrospective view often enables \\nus to increase cooling capacity of our existing facility, \\nthereby maximizing the amount of servers within our data \\ncenter  footprint. \\nIn 2022, we further improved energy efficiency at data \\ncenters by deploying our own server design, developed \\nwith a focus on energy and computing efficiency, resulting \\nin over 56. 7 million kilowatt-hours per year in energy \\nsavings. This work builds on previous efficiency efforts \\nin our data centers, including developing a specification \\nrequiring our servers to be powered by high-efficiency \\npower supplies  — exceeding even the efficiency \\nrequirements for ENERGY STAR certification  — which \\nwas deployed to hundreds of thousands of servers in \\n2021, resulting in over 4 million kilowatt-hours per year in \\nenergy  savings.\\nNew facilities: When designing new facilities, we \\nincorporate energy efficiency principles early in the \\nprocess. We look at each location’s conditions, planning \\nfor local temperature, humidity, and light. As each \\nsite becomes operational, we monitor how well we’re \\nperforming and make needed adjustments. For example, \\nin designing our new campus in Austin, we put in a water-\\ncooled air-conditioning system, rather than air-cooled, \\nbecause of its increased energy efficiency. At the same \\ntime, it was critical to consider the water stress of the \\narea, therefore the cooling system will be supplied with \\nrecycled water, which will also be used for toilet flushing. \\nThe first phase of our work on the Austin campus is \\nsaving 5. 7 million kilowatt-hours per year.\\nApple’s Reno data center, opened in 2012, takes advantage of the mild climate \\nby cooling its servers with outside air whenever possible.Energy efficiency \\naddresses \\nemissions  from:\\nDirect emissions \\n(scope 1)\\nIndirect \\nemissions \\n(scope 2)\\nProduct \\nmanufacturing \\n(scope 3)2023 Environmental Progress Report  17 Resources Smarter Chemistry Engagement and Advocacy Appendix Introduction Climate Change\\nRetail stores: In 2022, we were especially focused on our \\nefficiency measures in European retail stores as the region \\nnavigated energy shortages. Beyond aligning with all \\nmandates in place, we established a task force to exceed \\nthem, identifying and rolling out additional measures  — \\nrelated to LED lighting, temperature, and even keeping \\ndoors closed  — in retail stores across the continent.\\nMeasurement and accountability: Measurement is \\ncritical to maintaining building energy performance. We \\ncontinue to develop our system of energy tracking and \\nbenchmarking, which includes data from utility meters \\nthat continuously monitor 15-minute electricity and daily \\nnatural gas energy consumption. This method helps us \\nidentify performance issues at our sites early. We can \\nthen take corrective action to restore building system \\nefficiencies and actively manage our energy  footprint.Finally, across Apple, “energy champions” play an \\nimportant role in achieving our efficiency outcomes. \\nThese employees sit in facilities roles across the company, \\nproactively identifying opportunities for efficiencies and \\nbringing their teams and colleagues along to put them \\nin action.\\nIn 2022, our energy efficiency program avoided\\xa0 \\n69.4 million kilowatt-hours of electricity, which includes \\nsavings from the efficient servers, and 161,000\\xa0therms \\nof natural gas per year through adjustments made to \\n9.3 million square feet of new and existing buildings. \\nTogether, these new initiatives reduced total energy use \\nby 4 percent  in the targeted buildings (including data \\ncenters with high loads) and will avoid an additional \\n27,500 m etric tons of CO 2e per year. Combined with \\nongoing energy savings from past years, we saved over \\n89,000 m etric tons of CO 2e in 2022.69.4M\\nWe reduced Apple’s \\nfacilities energy use by \\n69.4 million kilowatt-hours \\nthrough efficiency efforts \\nimplemented in  2022.\\n1.3M\\nSuppliers in our Supplier \\nEnergy Efficiency\\xa0Program \\navoided more than 1. 3 million \\nannualized metric tons \\nof supply chain carbon \\nemissions in  2022.Improving energy  efficiency  \\nin our supply  chain\\nThe manufacturing of Apple products accounts \\nfor\\xa065 percent  of Apple’s gross carbon footprint. To \\naddress this impact, we’re collaborating closely with our \\nsuppliers to prioritize energy reductions as an important \\nelement of our strategy. Together, we work to use clean \\nenergy as efficiently as possible at every point in our \\nsupply chain, creating leaner, more efficient factories all \\nover the world. The Supplier Energy Efficiency Program, \\nlaunched in 2015, exists to help our suppliers optimize \\ntheir energy use. Implementing energy efficiencies \\nreduces the energy intensity of manufacturing, which \\ntranslates to reduced carbon  emissions.\\nEnergy efficiency gains and subsequent carbon savings \\nare often found at the facility level  — for example, by \\nreplacing outdated and inefficient lighting and equipment \\nor capturing waste heat for reuse. Honing manufacturing \\nprocesses using smart controls and monitoring can \\nalso offer opportunities to complete the same work with \\nless electricity. We support our suppliers’ energy efficiency projects by \\nhelping to identify optimization opportunities and design \\nsolutions through assessments, and providing extensive \\neducation and training opportunities that include \\ntechnical assistance and connections to external funding \\nfor energy efficiency projects, which can be an obstacle \\nto making improvements. As suppliers become more \\nknowledgeable in this space, they become more able to \\ntackle deeper decarbonization  challenges.\\nWe continue to expand the support we provide to \\nsuppliers as they build more energy-efficient systems, \\nthrough new training and educational materials, and \\nincreased access to funding opportunities  — like the \\nAsia Green Fund, which Apple launched in 2019 to help \\nprovide energy efficiency expertise and finance capital-\\nintensive energy efficiency projects. In 2022, $8. 9 million \\nof investments have been made in supplier efficiency \\nprojects using the Asia Green  Fund.\\nIn 2022, m ore than 100 supplier facilities participated \\nin our energy efficiency program, achieving over \\n1.6 billion  kilowatt-hours of electricity savings and about \\n2,039, 000 M MBtu in additional energy savings, which \\ntogether avoided over 1. 3 million metric tons of CO 2e, \\nrepresenting a 17 percent  increase since  2021.2023 Environmental Progress Report  18 Resources Smarter Chemistry Engagement and Advocacy Appendix Introduction Climate Change\\nReducing energy use begins with \\nmeasuring and understanding the \\ncarbon footprint of a business. Since \\n2019, as part of Apple’s Supplier \\nCode of Conduct, we’ve required our \\nsuppliers to regularly identify sources \\nof emissions, measure their scope 1 \\nand scope 2 carbon emissions, and \\nmake this information available to \\nApple as needed. By understanding \\na supplier’s carbon emission sources \\nand quantity, we can provide \\nresources that help the supplier \\ncreate an action plan to decarbonize \\nand maximize energy efficiency \\nopportunities. Further, we empower \\nour suppliers to utilize the trainings, \\nresources, and tools provided \\nthrough our programs to extend their \\nefforts beyond Apple to their own \\nsupply chains and  customers. Feature\\nApple calls on global supply chain \\nto decarbonize by 2030\\nApple has made significant progress in reducing \\nemissions in our supply chain through work on energy \\nefficiency and renewable energy (see page\\xa022 ). At the \\nsame time, we’ve set  — and continue to advance  — clear \\nexpectations for our suppliers on the decarbonization \\nrequired to meet our 2030 goal in the years to come.\\nIn October 2022, we urged\\xa0our materials, manufacturing, \\nand assembly partners to decarbonize their entire \\nApple footprint by 2030, including all their scope 1  and \\n2 emissions associated with Apple production. We’ll \\nevaluate our suppliers’ work to decarbonize their Apple-\\nrelated operations  — including running on 100 percent  \\nrenewable electricity  — and we’ll track yearly progress. \\nProgress toward these goals will be a crucial part of the \\ncriteria we consider when awarding future  business.\\nAdditionally, we encourage suppliers to address \\nthe greenhouse gas emissions beyond their Apple \\nproduction, prioritizing clean energy. To help suppliers \\nmeet their commitments and go even further, we offer \\na suite of free learning resources and trainings, and we \\nwork closely with our suppliers and local partners to \\nidentify effective solutions for renewable energy and \\ncarbon  removal. \\nOver 250 suppliers have committed to 100 percent renewable electricity for Apple production, as part of Apple’s Clean Energy Program. Holmen Iggesund in Sweden (pictured) joined the \\nprogram in 2023.2023 Environmental Progress Report  19 Resources Smarter Chemistry Engagement and Advocacy Appendix Introduction Climate Change\\nWe’re at a pivotal moment in \\naddressing climate change. \\nRenewable energy is poised to \\nreplace fossil fuels as the future of \\nelectricity.

In total, Apple-created renewable sources \\naccount for about 90 percent  of the renewable electricity \\nthat our facilities use  — currently around 1.5\\xa0gigawatts.\\nApple-created projects  include:\\n• Direct  ownership  \\n(~9 percent  of Apple -created  projects)  \\nWe build our own projects  — including solar, biogas \\nfuel cells, and low-impact hydro projects  — to provide \\nrenewable electricity, where  feasible.\\n• Equity  investment  \\n(~3 percent  of Apple -created  projects)  \\nWe invest capital in new solar PV or wind projects \\nin some markets, matching the renewable energy \\ngenerated with our energy  use.\\n• Long-term renewable energy  contracts  \\n(~88 percent  of Apple -created  projects)  \\nThrough long-term power purchase agreements, \\nvirtual power purchase agreements, and other forms \\nof long-term commitments, we help support new, \\nlocal, and primarily solar PV and wind projects in line \\nwith our renewable energy–sourcing  standards.2023 Environmental Progress Report  20 Resources Smarter Chemistry Engagement and Advocacy Appendix Introduction Climate Change\\nApple-created projects, we directly purchase renewable \\nelectricity through available utility green energy programs \\n(about 5 percent  of our total corporate load in 2022). \\nColocation and distribution facility vendors supply about \\n3.2 percent  of our total load of renewable energy. And \\nin certain situations, we purchase Renewable Energy \\nCertificates (RECs).22\\xa0These RECs, which account for \\nabout 3. 5 percent  of our total load, share the same \\npower grid as the Apple facility that they support, where \\navailable. These purchases are subject to the same \\nstandards as our Apple -created renewable energy \\nprojects. Appendix \\xa0B provides additional details on \\nApple’s renewable energy  solutions.\\nSupporting social  impact\\nWe launched our Power for Impact program in 2019 \\nto help provide local communities with needed energy \\nresources. With funding from Apple, local communities \\nand organizations gain access to cost -effective \\nenergy. At\\xa0the same time, Apple retains the projects’ \\nenvironmental attributes, benefiting the community, \\nour company, and the environment.

The California Flats storage project  — \\nan\\xa0industry-leading grid-scale battery energy storage \\nsystem capable of storing 240 m egawatt-hours of \\nelectricity  — became operational in 2021. This project \\nsupports the 130-megawatt California Flats solar \\nfarm, which provides most of our renewable energy in \\nCalifornia, by storing excess energy generated during the \\nday and deploying it when it’s most  needed.\\nWe’re also continuing to support biological methanation \\nresearch at Aarhus University, Denmark, which explores \\nthe production of synthetic methane for storage in the \\nexisting gas grid. In this process, bacteria consumes \\nboth hydrogen produced from excess renewable energy \\nand captured carbon dioxide to produce methane, the \\nprincipal component of natural gas. Methane produced \\nfrom renewables is a versatile energy carrier that can \\nbe used as a fuel source in households, industry, \\nand transportation.2023 Environmental Progress Report  21 Resources Smarter Chemistry Engagement and Advocacy Appendix Introduction Climate Change\\nTransitioning our suppliers \\nto\\xa0renewable  electricity\\nThe electricity that our manufacturing suppliers use \\nrepresents the largest single source of carbon emissions \\nthroughout our manufacturing supply chain.\\xa0That’s why \\nour efforts to facilitate the transition of our entire supply \\nchain to 100 percent  renewable electricity are essential \\nto reaching our 2030 goal of carbon neutrality. And the \\nbenefits extend beyond Apple. Suppliers are able to \\nimplement best practices in advocating for and procuring \\nrenewable energy across all their operations and to \\nshare them with their own partners. At the same time, \\ntransitioning to 100 percent  renewable electricity presents \\nchallenges: technical and regulatory barriers, need for \\ncapital investment, and lack of awareness about where to \\nfind and access high-quality and cost-effective  solutions.\\nOur Supplier Clean Energy Program helps enable \\nsuppliers’ transition to clean, renewable electricity through \\npolicy advocacy, providing information and access to \\nrenewable energy procurement options, and creating \\nengagement opportunities with renewable energy \\nexperts. To cover emissions from suppliers that we\\xa0don’t \\ncontract with directly, we plan on investing in additional \\nrenewable electricity projects. To date, we’ve directly \\ninvested in nearly 500 m egawatts of solar and wind \\nprojects in China and Japan.As of March 2023, over 250 suppliers making up \\nover 85\\xa0percent of Apple’s direct spend for materials, \\nmanufacturing, and assembly of our products worldwide \\nhave committed to using renewable electricity for \\ntheir Apple production. In total, the Supplier Clean \\nEnergy Program now has over 20 gigawatts of clean \\nenergy commitments, of which nearly two-thirds are \\nalready  operational. \\xa0\\nIn 2022, the 13.7 gigawatts of renewable energy \\nprocured by suppliers and online in Apple’s supply chain \\ngenerated 23. 7 million megawatt-hours of clean energy, \\navoiding 17. 4 million metric tons of carbon emissions  — \\na\\xa023 percent  increase over 2021.23\\xa0Appendix C includes \\nmore information about which suppliers have joined Apple \\nin transitioning to 100 percent  renewable  electricity.\\nIn many cases, our suppliers are leading the way with \\nthe efforts they’re undertaking. We work closely with our \\nsuppliers to identify innovative methods of creating and \\naccessing cost-effective renewable energy. And we work \\ntogether to break down barriers by advocating for clean \\nenergy–friendly  policies. Supply chain clean energy progress\\nRenewable electricity operational and committed in gigawatts (GW)How suppliers are responding\\nLong-standing energy policies and infrastructure that \\nincentivize the use of fuels like coal can make it difficult \\nto bring new renewable energy online in some regions, \\nprompting some of our suppliers to rely on less impactful \\nsolutions, like one-time purchases of energy attribute \\ncertificates from existing renewable energy projects. \\nThese options represent an annual cost for buyers \\nand offer no opportunity for cost savings or a return on \\ninvestment.\\xa0To overcome these challenges, suppliers are \\nleveraging new purchasing methods, creating renewable \\nenergy businesses, and even participating in some of the \\nworld’s largest and most innovative renewable energy \\ndeals. Suppliers are also adapting to changing renewable \\nenergy markets by finding new solutions, including first-\\nof-their-kind procurement structures in specific regions \\nthat include more corporate procurement  options. \\nIn China, this includes the Green Power Trading Platform \\nand cross-provincial power purchasing agreements that \\nhave provided suppliers with more options. South Korea \\nhas expanded its options for green power, including \\npower purchase agreements and the ability to purchase \\nrenewable energy credits. Japan has also introduced new \\nrenewable energy options, including power purchase \\nagreements and price-competitive nonfossil credits that \\nhave the potential to scale access to renewable energy \\nacross the market. While we’ve seen progress in key \\nmarkets, we continue to advocate for policies that enable \\nrenewable energy to compete fairly with fossil fuels, \\nopening more avenues for our suppliers to make the \\ntransition (see page  29).In the past two years, \\ntogether with our suppliers, \\nwe've more than tripled \\nthe amount of renewable \\nelectricity online in our \\nsuppl y chain.

Apple employees are passionate about the \\nenvironment and are driven to help meet our 2030 carbon \\nneutrality goal. We empower supplier-facing Apple \\nemployees  — those who often travel to supplier sites or \\nhave direct, consistent cadence with suppliers  — with \\nthe tools they need to help speed a supplier’s transition \\nto 100 percent  renewable electricity. This starts with \\ndata and transparency. We track the electricity use and \\nrenewable procurement of our suppliers, including those \\njust beginning to learn about renewable electricity and \\nothers that are well on their way to using 100 percent  \\nrenewable electricity, and we help them measure progress \\nand gain access to solutions. We’ve also created internal \\ntrainings and crafted a simple engagement process, \\nbacked by resources for both Apple employees and \\nsuppliers. By connecting our suppliers with resources and \\nproviding transparency on supplier progress, our teams \\nare scaling\\xa0impact across our supply  chain.Supporting supplier capacity\\nWe share the experience gained through our transition \\nto 100 percent  renewable electricity with our suppliers \\nbecause knowledge empowers them to identify and \\npursue opportunities to decarbonize as their businesses \\nevolve. For this reason, we invest heavily in providing \\neducation and training across our supply chain through \\nplatforms such as our Clean Energy  Academy. \\nMore than 170 supplier participants in China, Korea, \\nJapan, and Vietnam participated in our Clean Energy \\nAcademies in 2022. The academies offer updates on \\navailable energy procurement options in suppliers’ \\nmarkets, help suppliers prepare to participate in upcoming \\nrenewable energy pilots, and provide guidance from local \\nexperts on implementation. This program supplements \\nour Clean Energy Portal, which is available to all suppliers \\nand provides training materials, resources, and country-\\nspecific information to guide suppliers in their transition to \\n100 percent  renewable electricity. In 2022, we announced \\nplans to donate these resources to create a first-of-\\nits-kind public training platform that will be available to \\nbusinesses across many different industries. This platform \\nwill give companies of all sizes  — in Apple’s supply chain \\nand beyond  — access to the resources and advocacy \\nnetworks we’ve cultivated for nearly a  decade. We also educate suppliers through advanced and \\ncustomized trainings with leading experts. And we \\nsupport the creation and growth of renewable energy \\nindustry associations that our suppliers can join to learn \\nabout local  opportunities.\\nExpanding access to renewable electricity\\nTo support our suppliers’ transition to renewable \\nelectricity, we help them find high-quality solutions so \\nthey can decide how best to address their specific needs. \\nWhen we face barriers to accessing cost-effective clean \\nelectricity, we innovate. One such innovation, the China \\nClean Energy Fund, enables Apple and our suppliers to \\ninvest in clean energy. As of March 2023, the fund has \\ninvested in over 650 m egawatts of renewable electricity \\nprojects, with nearly 100 percent  of those investments \\nonline. We also connect suppliers with opportunities to \\nbuy renewable energy directly from project developers \\nand utilities as those models emerge around the globe.\\nAdvocating for policy change\\nOur collective ability to procure and enable high-quality \\nrenewable energy is often influenced by local policies. \\nEffective government policies and rules can remove \\nsignificant barriers to low-carbon solutions and enable \\nsolutions to rapidly scale. We recognize that to transition \\nto renewable energy effectively, clean energy investments \\nneed to make financial sense. But carbon-intensive \\nenergy sources, like coal and gas, often have an unfair \\nprice advantage because of explicit subsidies and the ignored costs of externalities, such as air pollution and \\ncarbon emissions. We’re encouraging governments not \\nto subsidize or expand carbon-intensive infrastructure \\nthat will inhibit competition and discourage the \\ndevelopment of new technologies, like renewable energy \\nand advanced energy storage technologies. We also \\nencourage governments to keep pace with the speed of \\ntechnological innovation, consider life cycle emissions of \\nenergy solutions, and support new energy solutions that \\neffectively reduce global  emissions.\\nWe lend our voice and stand with other companies and \\nNGOs to break down policy barriers to achieve thriving \\nclean energy markets. Across regions where our suppliers \\noperate, we engage with policy makers to support \\nrenewable energy that’s cost-effective, accessible to \\ncompanies, and sourced from high-quality projects \\nwith a material impact on local markets. For example, \\nwith RE100, an initiative that brings together the world’s \\nmost influential businesses through commitments to \\nuse 100 percent  renewable electricity, we’ve identified \\ncountry-level policy barriers to procuring renewable \\nelectricity. RE100 collates the challenges that member \\ncompanies face and advocates for changes on our behalf. \\nWe also cofounded the Asia Clean Energy Coalition, \\nwhich convenes a diverse coalition of leading renewables \\nprivate sector actors to enact critical policy shifts in \\nAsia that will enable a variety of corporate procurement \\noptions for renewable  energy. 2023 Environmental Progress Report  23 Resources Smarter Chemistry Engagement and Advocacy Appendix Introduction Climate Change\\nClean energy  projects\\nAs we expand on our strategy to cover product use \\nwith clean electricity, we’re considering a number of \\nfactors in selecting projects. In accordance with global \\ngreenhouse gas accounting standards, we’ll match the \\nelectricity consumption of our products with 100 percent  \\nclean electricity on an annual basis. While we’ll source \\nthe majority of our clean electricity from the region, we’re \\nmaintaining geographic flexibility for a portion of the \\nemissions so that we can target grids with higher carbon \\nintensity. This approach allows us to balance focusing \\non areas where our customers use our products and \\nmaximizing the social and environmental benefits of \\nadditional renewable energy. For example, while California \\nis a large market for Apple, we might build new renewable \\nenergy projects in other locations with lower clean energy \\npercentages on their grids, where the same renewable \\nenergy capacity can have a more significant  impact.\\nAs a first phase of this work, we’re working toward \\ndeveloping large-scale solar and wind projects in the \\nU.S. and Europe. In the U.S., we’ve invested in the \\n320-megawatt 2300-acre IP Radian solar project in \\nBrown County, Texas, and plans for additional projects in \\nthe U.S. are underway. In Europe, we plan to engage in \\nprojects that range between 30 and 300 m egawatts, with \\nan initial request for proposals issued in 2022.Engaging with our customers\\nIn many places, electricity comes from clean sources like \\nthe sun or wind at certain times of the day. Customers \\nplay an important role in deciding when to pull electricity \\nfrom the grid. We’re building programs to make those \\ndecisions easier for customers.\\xa0Clean Energy Charging, \\nwhich became available in the United States in fall 2022 \\nthrough iOS 16, enables customers to help decrease the \\ncarbon footprint of iPhone. The new feature looks at the \\nsources of electricity during expected charge times, and it \\noptimizes to reduce carbon by charging when the grid is \\nusing cleaner energy sources (learn more  here ).\\nBeyond the work that we do on our products, we \\ncollaborate with others to continue advancing climate-\\nsmart decision-making for customers across their \\nhousehold energy usage, as well as for our employees \\nand partners. As an example, Apple has joined the \\nCoolClimate Network, a research partnership of the \\nUniversity of California, Berkeley, that motivates and \\nempowers individuals and organizations to make low-\\ncarbon  choices. \\nApple is investing in renewable energy worldwide — including this large-scale solar project in Brown County, Texas — to help \\naddress the electricity customers use to charge their Apple devices.Product  use\\nThe electricity that our customers use to charge their \\nApple devices represents\\xa0 24 percent  of Apple’s gross \\ncarbon footprint. Increasing the energy efficiency of \\nour products helps drive down emissions from product \\nuse, and we’re taking steps to address the emissions \\nthat remain.\\nWhen Apple committed to running our business on \\n100 percent  renewable electricity in 2013  — a goal we \\nmet for our facilities in 2018  — we were early leaders \\nin this transition. As we address emissions tied to the \\nelectricity that our products use globally, our guiding \\nprinciples focus on three areas: exploring innovative \\nsolutions to minimize carbon emissions from product \\nuse, including energy efficiency (see page 14 ); building \\nclean electricity projects aimed at maximizing carbon \\nreductions and social impact; and engaging with our \\ncustomers to educate and provide opportunities to \\nsupport decarbonizing the  grid. 2023 Environmental Progress Report  24 Resources Smarter Chemistry Engagement and Advocacy Appendix Introduction Climate Change\\nPower for Impact is driven by the idea \\nthat access to clean energy creates \\nopportunities within communities \\nwhile benefiting our climate. Apple \\nlaunched the initiative in 2019 to \\nprovide underresourced communities \\nwith renewable power while \\nsupporting economic growth and \\nsocial  impact.\\nThe program funds clean energy projects that \\nare mutually beneficial  — local communities and \\norganizations get access to cost-effective energy, and \\nApple retains the environmental attributes of each project. \\nWe currently support 20 renewable projects around the \\nworld,  including:\\nColombia:  Apple helps bring a rooftop solar power \\nsystem online at the Hospital Infantil Santa Ana. The \\nmoney saved on energy bills will allow the hospital to \\npurchase more equipment and medications. A rooftop \\nsolar installation at Ciudad Don Bosco, a nonprofit that \\nprovides educational and social services for under-\\nresourced youth, helps the group advance its sustainable \\ndevelopment  goals.Democratic Republic of the Congo:  Apple provides \\naccess to renewable energy for the Malaika School, which \\nempowers Congolese girls and their communities through \\neducation, agriculture, water projects, health outreach, \\nsports, and vocational training. To support Malaika \\nstudents and teachers, this solar initiative builds on other \\nApple collaborations, including virtual Today at Apple \\nsessions on coding with Swift, photography, filmmaking, \\nand design, as well as other events with Apple Retail \\nteams and Diversity Network  Associations.\\nIsrael:  Apple supports the Nitzana Educational Eco-\\nVillage, a community for at-risk youth, with a 260-kilowatt \\nsolar system to help lower electricity costs. The savings \\nhelp enhance educational experiences for youth from \\nvarious  backgrounds.\\nNigeria:  A remote mini-grid project is under development \\nto provide energy access to community members and \\nreplace fossil fuels for some businesses. Apple will \\nalso continue to support the development of a solar \\npower system to serve primary healthcare centers in \\nthe state of Ondo, as well as 200 households in the \\nsurrounding  region.\\nPhilippines:  Apple helps fund an educational institution \\nthat provides scholarships to high-achieving, under-\\nresourced students by offsetting electricity expenses \\nthrough a new rooftop solar installation in Bataan.South Africa:  Apple will fund new rooftop solar \\ninstallations at a vocational school and at a home for \\nsenior citizens. Along with the four operational projects, \\nthese installations will reduce electricity costs, and \\nthe savings will help fund operating costs and expand \\nprograms to support underserved groups. Apple will \\ncontinue to bring electricity to over 3500 households that \\npreviously lacked access with local street  lighting. \\nThailand:  Apple helped establish a solar energy system \\nto replace the use of polluting diesel fuel for a remote \\nfishing village that relies on refrigerators to maintain the \\nquality of its fish products. We increased local renewable \\nenergy production and battery storage to improve reliable \\naccess to electricity.\\nVietnam:  Apple\\xa0helps provide solar electricity for 20 \\nschools around the country, and helps teach thousands of \\nchildren about sustainable development and STEM.\\nZambia:  A microgrid supported by Apple will provide \\npower to hundreds of households that are currently \\nwithout electricity. The project will reduce reliance and \\ncosts associated with imported diesel and gasoline for \\ngenerators, and it will increase the amount of power \\navailable to community organizations and businesses.\\nPower for Impact is expanding access to clean, affordable \\npower in different parts of the world.

The same is true for \\ncertain manufacturing processes and \\nthe transportation of our products. \\nTo address these emissions, we \\nseek technological solutions and \\nemissions abatement, and we’re \\nmoving away from fossil  fuels. \\nRethinking how aluminum is made\\nAs part of Apple’s commitment to reduce our products’ \\nenvironmental impact through innovation, we’ve partnered \\nwith aluminum companies and the governments of \\nCanada and Quebec to invest in ELYSIS  — a joint venture \\nto commercialize patented technology that eliminates \\ndirect greenhouse gas emissions from the traditional \\nsmelting process. This is a revolutionary advancement \\nin the manufacturing of one of the world’s most widely \\nused metals. Since our collaboration began in 2018, we’ve \\nhelped accelerate the development of this technology by \\nfacilitating the joint partnership and providing initial funding \\nand ongoing technical  support. \\nIn 2022, Apple shipped iPhone SE devices using ELYSIS \\naluminum, building on our 2019 purchase from the \\nfirst-ever commercial batch of aluminum resulting from \\nthe joint venture, used in the production of the 16-inch \\nMacBook Pro .24\\xa0The commercial-purity aluminum used \\nin these products is the first to be manufactured without \\ncreating any direct carbon emissions during the smelting \\nprocess. Throughout the past year, ELYSIS has also \\nAluminum is one of the world’s most widely used metals, and ELYSIS’ innovative \\ndirect carbon-free smelting process has the potential to reduce the climate impact \\nof\\xa0the production process.Direct emissions \\nabatement \\naddresses \\nemissions  from:\\nProduct \\nmanufacturing \\n(scope 3)\\nProduct \\ntransport \\n(scope 3)continued to make progress within its industrial research \\nand development center in Quebec  — enabling the venture \\nto begin producing commercial-purity primary aluminum at \\nindustrial scale  — and continued construction of its larger \\ncommercial-scale prototype  cells.\\nAddressing fluorinated greenhouse \\ngas emissions\\nOne of the largest contributors of direct emissions in \\nour supply chain is the use of fluorinated greenhouse \\ngases (F-GHGs). F-GHGs are used in the electronics \\nmanufacturing of semiconductors and flat-panel \\ndisplays, and they have global warming potentials that \\nare thousands of times more than those of CO 2. We’re \\npartnering closely with key manufacturers as they work \\nto prevent these gases from being released into the \\natmosphere. So while the use of F-GHGs in certain \\nmanufacturing processes today is difficult to avoid, \\nemissions can be abated by switching to alternative input \\ngases, by optimizing production processes to use and emit \\nfewer F-GHGs, and by installing gas abatement  tools.\\nTransporting  products\\nTo transport our products from our manufacturers to \\nour customers, we’re shifting to shipping modes that \\nare less carbon-intensive than air transport, such as by \\nocean, whenever possible.\\xa0In 2022, we launched three \\nnew products  — Mac Studio, Studio Display, and AirPods \\n(3rd generation)  — that leveraged ocean shipping by \\nenabling an ocean supply chain from our manufacturers. \\nOn average, shipping an item by ocean instead of on an \\nairplane reduces transportation-related emissions by \\n95 percent .25We’re also seeking out technical innovations for transport, \\nincluding working with our suppliers to use alternative fuels \\nand electric vehicles. For example, in Europe we piloted \\na heavy-duty truck fueled by hydrogen, an emerging \\nlow-carbon fuel for trucks that travel long distances. And \\nwe’re continuing to evaluate carriers that offer carbon-\\nneutral deliveries using electric vehicles, including e-bikes \\nand e-cars. These innovations help reduce our impact \\nin the communities where our customers purchase our \\nproducts. And by preferring vendors that offer low-carbon \\noptions, we signal the value of these options to us and \\nreward those driving decarbonization in their industry. We \\nare also combining multiple products into one delivery \\nwhen possible, reducing packaging and reducing \\nemissions though efficiency on the last leg of the journey. \\nAt the same time, Apple is working to spur entirely new \\nsolutions, for example by supporting analyses by Carbon \\nDirect\\xa0identifying pathways for developing sustainable \\naviation  fuels.\\nImproving employee travel \\nand commute\\nAnd we’re exploring ways to reduce our carbon footprint \\nfrom employees commuting to work. For example, we’re \\nhelping our employees transition away from single-\\noccupancy vehicles through mass transit, coach services, \\nand campus bicycles. To\\xa0incentivize the use of electric \\nvehicles, we offer more than 1670 EV charging stations \\nand 3200 ports across our U.S.-based campuses. For the \\ncommute-related emissions that remain, we’re applying \\nhigh-quality  offsets.2023 Environmental Progress Report  26 Resources Smarter Chemistry Engagement and Advocacy Appendix Introduction Climate Change\\nCarbon removal\\nOur 2030 Climate Roadmap aims to \\nreduce our emissions by 75 percent  \\ncompared with 2015 levels, as \\nwell as scale up carbon removal \\nstrategies to address the remaining \\nemissions that we can’t yet avoid. \\nWe’re exploring a range of carbon \\nremoval solutions to do so, which is \\nconsistent with the Intergovernmental \\nPanel on Climate Change’s position \\nthat all pathways limiting warming \\nto 1.5° C require carbon removal for \\nunavoidable emissions.26\\nCarbon removal projects take carbon dioxide out of \\nthe atmosphere and store it in long-term carbon sinks, \\nwhether nature-based  — like forests, wetlands, and \\ngrasslands  — or geologically, in formations such as saline \\naquifers or other suitable geological sites. In addition to \\nremoving carbon, nature-based carbon removal projects \\nalso offer important ecological and social benefits, such \\nas preserving biodiversity and enhancing the resilience of \\necosystems while often providing economic development \\nopportunities for local  communities.Investing in nature\\nThe earth’s trees, plants, and soils provide some of the \\ngreatest capabilities to remove and store carbon from \\nthe atmosphere. Carbon credits provide an opportunity \\nto invest in these solutions, but carbon markets haven’t \\nyet scaled to remove the carbon needed to limit global \\nwarming to 1.5° C. That’s why we’re expanding nature-\\nbased investments to support our goal of achieving \\ncarbon neutrality across our full product life cycle \\nby 2030. \\nIn 2021, we partnered with Conservation International \\nand Goldman Sachs to launch the Restore Fund, which \\nhas closed over $ 100 m illion in projects that forecast to \\nremove over one million metric tons of carbon starting \\nin 2025. This fund is unique because it aims to change \\ncarbon removal from a cost to a potentially profitable \\ninvestment. By creating a fund that generates both a \\nfinancial return as well as real and measurable carbon \\nimpact, we aim to drive broader change  — encouraging \\ncapital investment in carbon removal around the globe.\\nThrough the first phase of the Restore Fund, we’re working with forestry managers to create sustainably managed forests that are optimized for both \\ncarbon and wood production, creating revenue from timber and generating high-quality carbon credits.

Together, \\nthis unique blended fund structure will continue \\nto demonstrate that we can invest in high-quality \\nnature-based projects to achieve both financial and \\ncarbon  returns.\\nIntegrity and a rigorous approach are central to how \\nwe designed the Restore Fund with our partners. \\nThe projects aim to become certified to international \\nstandards developed by organizations such as Verra, \\nGold Standard, the Climate, Community & Biodiversity \\nAlliance (CCBA), and the Forest Stewardship Council \\n(FSC). Use of these international standards helps\\xa0confirm \\nthat the carbon stored in forests is measured and \\nreported to the highest standards and that projects have \\nthe most up-to-date safeguards in place. The projects \\nwe choose will also seek to have a positive impact on the \\nlivelihoods of local communities by bringing economic \\nopportunities to often underserved rural economies. And \\nwe’ll continue to focus on projects that protect lands with \\nhigh conservation  values.The first phase of our innovative fund has focused on \\nblending responsible forestry practices with carbon \\nremoval. We’re working with forestry managers to create \\nsustainably managed forests that are optimized for both \\ncarbon and wood production in order to create revenue \\nfrom timber and generate high-quality carbon credits. \\nThe projects also seek to maximize environmental \\nimpact, including carbon, hydrology, and habitat \\nrestoration. In October 2022, Apple announced three \\nnew projects through the Restore Fund. In partnership \\nwith Conservation International and Goldman Sachs, \\nApple has invested with three high-quality forestry \\nmanagers in Brazil and Paraguay\\xa0with the goal of restoring \\n150,000 acres of certified sustainable working forests \\nand protecting around 100,000 acres of native forests, \\ngrasslands, and wetlands. Together, these initial forestry \\nprojects are forecast to remove one million metric tons of \\ncarbon dioxide from the atmosphere starting in  2025. To improve the accuracy of monitoring, reporting, and \\nverification of the projects’ carbon removal impact, Apple \\nis deploying innovative remote sensing technologies \\nusing Space Intelligence’s Carbon and Habitat Mapper \\nand Upstream Tech’s Lens. Using high-resolution \\nsatellite imagery from Maxar and other providers, this \\ninitiative enables us to view detailed habitat and forest \\ncarbon maps for our Restore Fund projects. Through \\nour engagement with the MIT Climate & Sustainability \\nConsortium, Apple is jointly funding research with \\nPepsiCo and Cargill on improving the measurement of \\nsoil carbon in nature-based carbon removal projects. And \\nApple is separately exploring the use of LiDAR data using \\niPhone to improve field measurements of forest  carbon.\\nBased on our learnings with these projects and the \\ngrowing global need for more nature-based solutions, \\nApple announced an expansion of the Restore Fund in \\n2023. Apple has committed additional funds  — up to \\n$200 m illion  — that will be managed by Climate Asset \\nManagement, a joint venture between HSBC Asset \\nManagement and Pollination. The commitment will \\nsupport a broader portfolio of high-quality nature-based \\nprojects that scale up carbon removal while seeking to \\nachieve a financial return on investment.High-quality carbon offsets \\nas\\xa0an\\xa0 interim  solution\\nWe plan to reach our goal of becoming carbon neutral \\nacross our entire value chain by 2030, using a wide \\nrange of solutions at our disposal, prioritizing significant \\nemissions reductions and long-term carbon removal \\ninitiatives like the Restore Fund. But as the projects in the \\nRestore Fund come online, we’re also working to address \\ndifficult-to-avoid emissions in the short  term. \\nWe’ve been carbon neutral for our corporate emissions \\nsince April 2020. We started by reducing our corporate \\nemissions through the use of 100 percent  renewable \\nelectricity and energy efficiency efforts at our facilities. \\nBut emissions remain difficult to avoid in some \\nactivities  — including the natural gas used in some of \\nour buildings and emissions from business air travel and \\nemployee  commute. \\nFor the emissions we can’t avoid, we use high-quality \\noffsets as an interim solution.

In addition \\nto strong actions by businesses \\nand individuals, we need strong \\ngovernment policies that support a \\njust climate transition. That’s why \\nApple believes that\\xa0advocating for \\nstrong climate policies is a core part \\nof our climate  strategy. \\nApple has a long history of advocating for strong climate \\npolicies. And in 2022 Apple, joined by other companies, \\nsubmitted an Amicus Brief, urging the Supreme Court to \\nuphold the U.S. EPA’s authority to regulate greenhouse \\ngases from power  plants. FEATURE\\nAdvocating for strong \\nclimate policies\\nOur climate policy advocacy centers on the \\nfollowing  principles:\\nSetting strong science-based  targets\\nPolicy makers need to set strong science-based targets \\nto reduce emissions in line with the Paris\\xa0Agreement and \\nlimit warming to 1.5° C.\\nRapidly decarbonizing through economy-wide \\nand\\xa0 sectoral policies\\nRapid decarbonization requires every sector of the \\neconomy to adopt new zero-carbon technologies as \\nfossil fuels phase out. We not only support economy-wide \\npolicies but also acknowledge that each sector responds \\nto different signals and the maturity of technologies \\nto decarbonize them isn’t equal. Apple’s advocacy for \\nsectoral approaches includes these  principles: \\n• Promote economy-wide carbon pricing programs \\nwith strong interim and long-term targets and \\naccountability  mechanisms. \\n• Advocate for policies that make it easier and more \\ncost-effective to deploy renewable  energy.\\n• Support policies that promote energy efficiency \\nacross all sectors, including for manufactured  goods.\\n• Invest in mature and new zero-emission technologies \\nto cut emissions, particularly in hard-to-\\ndecarbonize  sectors. Encouraging and enabling high-quality measurement \\nand disclosure of emissions\\nGovernments should require that companies measure \\ntheir emissions along the entire value chain and disclose \\nthose emissions publicly. Developing clear rules for \\ndisclosure across all scopes of emissions will create best \\npractices, enhance the transparency and integrity of \\nclaims, and promote competitive innovation. Governments \\nshould align to have the same high-quality  standards.\\nEnsuring high-quality solutions \\nGovernments should establish or oversee systems \\nto track and verify renewable energy credits and \\ncarbon credits to avoid double-counting, to incentivize \\nparticipation, and to ensure environmental integrity. These \\ncredits should be transparent and verified to provide \\nconfidence to the public, and they promote energy \\nsolutions that significantly reduce emissions, including \\nconsideration of the full value chain  impact.\\nCentering equity and justice in climate solutions \\nClimate policies should support the development of \\nthe new green economy, with new job opportunities \\nfocused on advancing clean innovation. Equity should be \\na guiding principle of policies supporting this economy. \\nCommunities that have been disproportionately impacted \\nby climate change should benefit from the economic \\nopportunities of potential  solutions.[We] believe that both corporate \\nand regulatory action are \\nnecessary to prevent the worst \\nimpacts of climate change and \\nhave a strong interest in the \\nimplementation of sound public \\npolicies to reduce greenhouse \\ngas emissions.\\nBrief Amici Curiae of Apple et al.,  \\nWest Virginia vs EPA (2022).2023 Environmental Progress Report  29 Resources Smarter Chemistry Engagement and Advocacy Appendix Introduction Climate Change\\n2015 (U.S.):  Apple joined the White House’s \\nAmerican Business Act on Climate Pledge, in \\nwhich participating companies voiced support \\nfor a strong outcome at the COP21 in Paris \\nand demonstrated an ongoing commitment to \\nclimate  action.\\n2016 (U.S.):  Apple joined Google, Microsoft, and \\nAmazon to sign an Amicus Brief in support of the \\nU.S. EPA’s Clean Power  Plan.\\n2016 (World):  Apple addressed 700 senior \\ngovernment, business, and community leaders at \\nthe seventh Clean Energy Ministerial, where we \\ncalled for governments across the world to put a \\nprice on carbon to address climate  change.\\n2017 (U.S.):  Apple urged the White House \\nto remain in the Paris Agreement and take \\nmeaningful action on climate  change.2017 (China): Apple hosted a roundtable with \\nthe Green Electricity Consumption Cooperative \\nOrganization (GECCO) to create a platform \\nfor buyers in China where they can discuss \\nrenewable energy procurement challenges and \\nopportunities and inform future  policy.2018 (China): Apple submitted formal \\ncomments to China’s National Development \\nand Reform Commission about the \\nimplications of draft policy on corporate clean \\nenergy  procurement.\\n2018 (South Korea):  Apple met with \\ngovernment officials in Korea to discuss the \\nneed for increased renewable generation and \\nretail choice, whereby consumers can select \\ntheir power  source. \\n2018 (Japan): Apple was among the first \\nmultinational companies to join the Japan \\nClimate Leaders’ Partnership, a coalition of \\ncompanies that align business objectives with \\nenvironmental  goals.\\n2019 (Vietnam): Apple urged the \\ngovernment to reform the electricity market, \\nallowing businesses to purchase power \\ndirectly from renewable power  plants.\\n2019 (World): Apple participated in the \\nUN Environment Assembly and conducted \\nbilateral discussions with a number of \\ncountries to advocate for policies that enable a \\ncircular economy and bold action on climate.2020 (EU):  Apple called on European leaders to \\nincrease their climate ambition to achieve targets \\nof at least 55 percent  greenhouse gas emissions \\nreductions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050. \\nThe EU adopted these  targets.

This serves \\nour objective to minimize the overall resource footprint \\nsupporting our products. And we know that we can’t \\ndo this alone  — it requires collaborative stewardship of \\nshared  resources.In the future we envision, our products are made solely \\nfrom responsibly sourced recycled and renewable \\nmaterials  — to our same rigorous standards of quality \\nand durability. We aim to build durable, long-lasting \\nproducts that make the best use of the resources \\nrequired to make them. And recycling approaches and \\ninnovations make this achievable, helping us recover \\nand use the materials that we rely on in our products to \\ntheir full potential. We’re working with leading recyclers \\nand academic institutions to realize this future through \\nresearching new technologies and identifying the \\nchallenges and opportunities to achieve positive change \\nacross  industries.\\nWater is one of the most critical resources we need \\nto build our products. It provides vital services at our \\noffices, data centers, and stores  — and it’s essential to \\nour manufacturing processes. Water is also a community \\nresource. For this reason, we prioritize our stewardship \\nefforts  — working toward the most efficient use of \\nfreshwater, using alternatives where possible, and \\nmanaging our discharge responsibly. We also look beyond \\nour facilities to the water basins where we operate. \\nThrough collaborations with local partners  — including \\ncompanies, NGOs, and government agencies  — we’re \\nworking together to improve the quality of the water that \\nour communities rely on.Materials\\nTransition to only recycled or renewable materials in our products and \\npackaging, and maximize material efficiency, product longevity, and recovery.\\nZero waste\\nMinimize overall waste generated and eliminate waste sent to landfill from our \\nmanufacturing supply chain as well as corporate offices, data centers, and \\nretail  stores.Water\\nReduce water impacts in the manufacturing of our products, use of our \\nservices, and our facility operations. At the same time, transition to alternative \\nsolutions, improve the quality of water that we discharge, and protect shared \\nwater  resources.Within resources, we focus on \\nthree main areas of  impact:Another approach to conserving resources is by \\neliminating waste. We work to reuse and recycle across \\nour operations and throughout our supply chain. We \\nstrive to\\xa0eliminate waste where we and our suppliers \\noperate. These efforts go beyond reducing the amount \\nof waste that we generate. We’re innovating approaches \\nto reuse and working with local businesses to create new \\nrecycling  opportunities.\\nWe can move ahead only by working with others. \\nWhen we collaborate with suppliers, NGOs, recyclers, \\ncommunity stakeholders, and innovation leaders, we can \\ndo more while relying on less  — and reduce our overall \\ncarbon and material  footprint.2023 Environmental Progress Report  33 Climate Change Smarter Chemistry Engagement and Advocacy Appendix Introduction Resources\\nMaterials\\nWe’re working toward a world where \\nwe create our products from, and \\nwhere we contribute to, circular \\nsupply chains.\\xa0This starts by building \\nproducts that are circular by design \\nand made from responsibly sourced \\nrecycled and renewable materials. \\nThis work will help us end reliance on \\nmining, which is often both\\xa0carbon-\\nintensive and detrimental to the \\ncommunities and ecosystems where \\nit takes  place.We aim to create products that make greater use of \\ncircular supply chains that don’t rely on mined resources. \\nThey do so while meeting our rigorous requirements \\nfor quality, durability, and performance. Part of what \\nmakes this possible are the recycling innovations we’re \\ndeveloping to enhance material recovery. While these \\ninnovations support circular supply chains for Apple, \\nwe\\xa0also hope our actions are inspiring others to follow.\\nThis progress can impact those who buy our products, \\ncan influence the markets where we work, and can create \\nchange for broader global communities. These are the \\nopportunities that drive us through the challenging work \\nof creating circular supply  chains.\\nThe following three pillars define our approach \\nto\\xa0achieving circularity:\\nSourcing and efficiency\\nWe source recycled and renewable materials for our \\nproducts and packaging, and we use these materials \\nmore efficiently. We also source the materials responsibly, \\nwhether from primary, recycled, or renewable  sources.\\nSOURCING\\nSource materials that are \\nrecycled and renewable\\nPRODUCTION\\nMake products that last through \\ndurability, repair, and refurbishingEFFICIENCY\\nDesign efficiency into our products \\nand manufacturing processesRECOVER Y\\nRecover materials for use \\nin\\xa0new productsHow we pursue circularity for our  products\\nSourcing and efficiency\\nWe continue to progress toward our goal of relying solely \\non\\xa0responsibly sourced recycled or renewable materials \\nfor our products and  packaging. \\nThe source of the materials we rely on matters to us. \\nWe place a clear value on materials that don’t deplete \\nthe earth’s resources. As we move toward recycled and \\nrenewable content, we’re joined in our efforts by many \\npartners. We look forward to engaging with many others \\nas part of a broader global transition. As we design new \\nproducts, we continue to source materials responsibly \\nand continue to use materials efficiently and safely.Product longevity\\nWe make the most of the materials we use by designing \\nlong-lasting products. We design durable hardware, \\nleverage software updates to extend functionality, \\nprovide convenient access to safe and high-quality repair \\nservices, and direct devices and parts to be refurbished \\nand reused.\\nCollection and recovery\\nWe improve how we collect end-of-life products and \\ndevelop recycling innovations so that we and others can \\nuse old devices as raw material sources for the future.2023 Environmental Progress Report  34 Climate Change Smarter Chemistry Engagement and Advocacy Appendix Introduction Resources\\nExpanding our use of recycled  content\\nOur progress on materials continued in 2022 as we’ve \\nmoved closer to creating a circular supply chain for \\nseveral materials. With tin, we first proved in 2017 that \\nwe could use 100 percent  recycled tin for the solder on \\nthe main logic board (where the majority of tin is found) \\nof iPhone 6s and in 2022, we’re now using 100 percent  \\nrecycled tin on many flexible printed circuit boards used \\nacross\\xa0almost all newly launched products. This resulted \\nin the total shipped recycled tin increasing to 38 percent  \\nacross all product lines in 2022  — up from 30 percent  \\nin 2021. We took a similar approach with gold. Across \\nall products, we expanded our use of certified recycled \\ngold  — from the gold plating on the main logic board on \\niPhone to other product main logic boards and flexible \\nprinted circuit boards  — increasing certified recycled gold \\ncontent to approximately 4 percent  across all products \\nthat shipped in 2022  — up from just 1 percent  in 2021.30 \\nThese and other innovations helped us increase our use \\nof recycled and\\xa0renewable content to 20 percent  of all the \\nmaterial shipped in products in 2022.31\\nWe’ve also achieved several\\xa0milestones with copper \\nand zinc. For iPad models introduced in October 2022, \\nwe’re using 100 percent  recycled copper foil in the main \\nlogic board. For Mac Studio and Studio Display, we’ve \\ndeveloped a brass alloy using 100 percent  recycled \\ncopper and zinc for use in the AC inlet and cable prongs. \\nFinally, since last year, we’ve nearly doubled our use of \\nrecycled cobalt in batteries to 27 percent  across iPhone, \\niPad, and Mac devices year over year, bringing the total \\nrecycled cobalt shipped in 2022 to\\xa0 25 percent .32Prioritizing our efforts\\nOur recycled and renewable efforts continue to focus \\non 14 m aterials that we’ve prioritized based on a broad \\nrange of environmental, social, and supply chain impacts. \\n(These are outlined in detail in our Material Impact Profiles  \\nwhite paper.33) Some of the materials prioritized through \\nthis process include lower-mass but higher-impact \\nmaterials. Our priority materials include aluminum, cobalt, \\ncopper, glass, gold, lithium, paper, plastics, rare earth \\nelements, steel, tantalum, tin, tungsten, and zinc, and they \\naccount for 87 percent  of the total product mass shipped \\nto our customers in 2022.34\\xa0\\nOur teams are overcoming many obstacles to creating \\nclosed loop supply chains, including material performance \\nand traceability. This is possible through our work with a \\ndiverse group of partners. We’ve been able to design a \\nnew, 100 percent  recycled aluminum alloy that meets our \\nrigorous performance standards. And we’ve improved \\nour ability to track key materials like batteries within our \\nsupply chain, end-to-end.\\nBarriers to our progress remain  — including challenges \\nwithin our control and those outside Apple’s direct \\ninfluence.\\xa0Addressing these requires a collective \\nresponse. But through collaboration within the material \\nspace, we can achieve impact felt beyond our business. \\nThe supply chains we’re helping create serve more than \\njust our needs  — they help promote the availability of \\ncompetitively priced, quality recycled and renewable \\nmaterials across  geographies. Maintaining high standards for materials is an essential \\nelement of this work. Our\\xa0recycled and renewable \\nmaterial specifications\\xa0follow standards established by \\nthe international community.35 Through this process, \\nwe’re able to confirm that a material has been recycled \\nor comes from a renewable source  — one that can \\ncontinually produce without depleting the earth’s \\nresources.36\\xa0We approach materials from new sources \\nwith the same rigor, evaluating each for the safety of the \\nmaterials’ chemistry. This process allows us to scale our \\nuse of materials that are better for the environment and \\nsafe for use in our products.\\nResponsible sourcing of materials\\nThis diligence carries over to sourcing. We obtain our \\nresources responsibly, regardless of whether we’re \\nusing primary or recycled materials. This approach is a \\nnecessary complement to our environmental efforts  — \\nand it draws from the same reliance on international \\nstandards. Our standards for Responsible Sourcing of  \\nMaterials  are based on leading international guidance, \\nincluding the United Nations’ Guiding Principles on \\nBusiness and Human Rights and the Organisation for \\nEconomic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Due \\nDiligence Guidance. In 2022, 100 percent  of the identified \\ntin, tantalum, tungsten, gold (3TG), cobalt, and lithium \\nsmelters and refiners in Apple’s supply chain completed \\nassessments to verify compliance with our standards, and \\nto aid in identifying social, environmental, human rights, \\nand governance risks. We also map other materials in our \\nproducts such as mica, copper, graphite, and nickel, and, \\nbefore production, evaluate suppliers of new materials \\nfor compliance with our requirements. We also continue \\nto map, conduct additional due diligence, and facilitate independent third-party audits on other materials used \\nin our products, such as graphite, nickel, and copper. \\nAs we build supply chains for recycled materials, we’re \\nalso partnering with the smelters and refiners identified \\nthrough this process.\\nIndustry  collaboration\\nAs we focus on responsible sourcing and the use of \\nrecycled content, we continue to engage with multiple \\nindustry initiatives. These include our role on the steering \\ncommittee of the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI). \\nThis coalition is one of the most commonly used \\nresources for companies  —\\xa0from a range of industries  — \\nthat are working to address mineral sourcing issues in \\ntheir supply chains. We are also a board member of the \\nPlatform for Accelerating the Circular Economy (PACE) \\nand co-lead the electronics program. PACE is a global \\ncollaboration platform for public and private decision \\nmakers to share a vision, best practices, and innovations \\ntoward a circular economy. Apple is a co-champion of \\nthe First Movers Coalition for Aluminum, whose focus \\nis to aggregate demand signals for ultra low carbon \\ntechnologies and materials. We also collaborate with \\nother industry organizations, including the Aluminum \\nStewardship Initiative, to promote transparency across \\nsupply chains and implement additional commodity-\\nspecific auditing and due diligence  systems. \\nUsing recycled and renewable materials helps lower our \\ncarbon footprint, moving us closer to our climate goals. \\nTo fulfill the transition to these materials, we’re working \\nwith policy makers to support international standards that \\nenable the use of these materials  globally.Apple is committed to \\nsetting the highest standards \\nfor responsible sourcing \\nof the materials used in \\nour products.

As we work toward our \\ngoals, we’ll continue to be open about \\nthe challenges that we encounter.Key challenges to developing circular supply \\nchains include:\\nTechnical properties\\nThe properties of a recycled or renewable material \\nmay differ from the primary material. This needs to be \\naccounted for during product design and manufacturing. \\nFor example, select recycled plastics differ in properties \\nfrom other plastics. The composition of other recycled \\nmaterials can also be impacted by some level of \\ncontamination during the recycling  process.\\nAvailability and access\\nSupply of recycled and renewable materials can be \\nconstrained by the limited availability of scrap sources \\nor production of renewable content. When supply exists \\nin some locations around the world, new suppliers need \\nto be incorporated into supply chains for the material to \\nbe accessed.\\nSupply chains\\nRecycled or renewable content may not be easily \\naccessible on the market, requiring the development of \\nnew supply  chains.FEATURE\\nProgress across our priority materials\\nTraceability\\nInformation about the source of materials  — whether \\nmined, recycled, or renewable  — might not be \\nreadily  available. \\nScale\\nMaterials for a single component can come from \\nhundreds of different material suppliers, representing \\nan exponential increase in effort as we scale the use \\nof high-quality recycled or renewable materials across \\ncomponents and products.\\nRegulatory barriers \\nTransboundary movement regulations  — created \\nto establish critically important community and \\nenvironmental protections  — can have the unintended \\nconsequence of inhibiting the ability to recover and \\nmove materials to best-in-class recyclers or refiners \\nfor use in new products. Read about our support of \\npolicies in our feature on circular economy policy  that \\nenable circular supply chains while improving social \\nand\\xa0 environmental  protections.\\nAluminum Regulatory barriers  \\nTechnical properties  \\nScaleWe’re continuing to scale our new, 100 percent recycled aluminum alloy — which incorporates \\nrecycled content without compromising performance — across all products. Overall, in 2022, \\n67 percent of the aluminum we shipped came from recycled sources — up from 59 percent in \\n2021.41 Of the products introduced during this period,\\xa0iPad Air (5th generation), Apple Watch \\nSeries 8, Apple Watch SE (2nd generation), and MacBook Air with M2 all contain 100 percent \\nrecycled aluminum in their enclosures. Apple Studio Display contains 100 percent recycled \\naluminum in the stand, and Apple TV 4K (3rd generation) contains 80 percent recycled \\naluminum in the thermal module. Because recycled aluminum can have 1/40th the carbon \\nfootprint of aluminum from primary sources, this supports our pursuit of low-carbon design.42 \\nOur recycled material comes from several sources, including scrap from the manufacture of \\nApple products and other postindustrial sources. And our product claims are supported by \\nsuppliers who have taken the additional step of getting their recycled content certified by an \\nindependent, third party.\\nCobalt Regulatory barriers  \\nAvailability and access  \\nScaleIn\\xa02022,\\xa025\\xa0percent\\xa0of the cobalt shipped in our products — nearly double the amount shipped \\nin 2021 — came from certified recycled sources on a mass-balance basis, including both \\npostindustrial scrap and post consumer scrap from end-of-life batteries. The cobalt from \\niPhone batteries disassembled by Daisy is being returned to the market, making the material \\navailable to others. And in 2023, Apple committed to using 100 percent recycled cobalt in all \\nApple-designed batteries by 2025.43Material Key challenges Progress\\nCopper Technical properties  \\nSupply chains  \\nScaleElectronics applications require the use of high-performance copper. Yet even as challenges \\nremain in identifying quality scrap sources, we’re making progress. In March 2022, we \\nintroduced 100 percent recycled copper for the first time in any Apple product: Apple Studio \\nDisplay and Mac Studio both use 100 percent recycled copper in the brass prongs of the \\npower cord plug and AC inlet. We also continue testing 100 percent recycled copper in other \\napplications to evaluate its technical properties and performance across product lines. Copper \\nis also a key material in printed circuit boards. For iPad (10th generation), introduced in October \\n2022, we’re using 100 percent recycled copper foil in the main logic board — Apple’s first use of \\nstandalone recycled copper.\\nGlass Technical properties  \\nAvailability and access  \\nScaleRecycled sources are scarce for the quality of glass that we use in our products — and \\nperformance of this material is key to the durability of our final products. We’re working hard \\nto identify recycled content and incorporate it into the material that we use to produce glass \\nparts. The cover glass and back glass of all iPhone and iPad devices contain recycled glass. By \\nincorporating quality scrap in our applications, we also help keep glass at its highest-purity use \\nfor future recovery.2023 Environmental Progress Report  37 Climate Change Smarter Chemistry Engagement and Advocacy Appendix Introduction Resources\\nGold Regulatory barriers  \\nTransparency  \\nScaleIn 2021, iPhone 13 models were the first Apple devices to contain 100 percent certified recycled \\ngold, used in the plating of the main logic board and wire of the front and rear cameras. In \\n2022, we expanded our use to the wire of every camera of iPhone 14 and to the plating of \\nthe printed circuit boards of all newly released Apple Watch models, to iPad Pro 11-inch (4th \\ngeneration), and to AirPods Pro (2nd generation), increasing our use of recycled gold to about \\n4 percent in 2022 across all product lines — up from 1 percent in 2021. Because primary and \\nsecondary sources of gold are often commingled, to certify 100 percent recycled sources \\nrequired pioneering industry-leading levels of traceability: we identified suppliers who were able \\nto source and segregate recycled gold sources while meeting our due diligence requirements; \\nthen we elevated these suppliers as preferred vendors. This level of traceability helped us to \\nbuild out a supply chain of exclusively certified recycled content. And in 2023, we committed \\nto using 100 percent recycled gold plating in all Apple-designed rigid and flexible printed circuit \\nboards by 2025.44 All gold in Apple products is responsibly sourced, whether it’s primary or \\nrecycled. For more information, see our Conflict Minerals Report .\\nRare earth  \\nelementsRegulatory barriers  \\nAvailability and access  \\nScaleMore than 73 percent of the total rare earth elements that Apple shipped in products in 2022 \\ncame from certified recycled sources, a significant increase from 45 percent used in 2021. \\nTo\\xa0reach this progress, we’ve focused on\\xa0rare earth elements used in magnet manufacturing — \\npraseodymium, neodymium, terbium, and dysprosium — and worked with our supply chain to \\nbuild circular supply paths for the rare earth elements. And we’re featuring greater percentages \\nof recycled rare earth element content across our latest devices: 100 percent in iPhone 14 and \\nApple Watch Series 8, 99 percent in iPhone 14 Pro Max and Apple Watch Ultra, and 98\\xa0percent \\nin MacBook Air with M2. We’re also committed to using 100 percent recycled rare earth \\nelements in all magnets across all products by 2025.46\\nLithium Regulatory barriers  \\nAvailability and access  \\nScaleWe’re shifting toward recycled materials recovered from batteries as they become more \\nviable and economical. We’ve worked to identify sources of recycled content and test the \\nperformance of the recycled material to see if it meets our requirements — both at the material \\nlevel and in its application in batteries. This rigorous evaluation is key to maintaining our \\nproducts’ performance as we transition to recycled content over the long term. In\\xa0January 2023, \\nApple began using recycled lithium for the first time in some of our batteries for some products, \\nand we’re in the process of getting this material third-party certified.45\\nSteel Regulatory barriers  \\nTechnical properties  \\nScaleSince steel is a highly recycled material, we focus on keeping it in the highest-quality form \\npossible, working to recover high-purity steel from our manufacturing scrap and our products \\nat end of life. We’re collaborating with our supply chain partners on opportunities to expand the \\nuse of recycled content into components of our products. Scaling the use of recycled steel is \\na key challenge because there are multiple layers in the supply chain between the raw material \\nand the many components that ultimately become part of our products. We’re making progress \\nin realigning these supply chains to use more recycled material. In June 2022, we introduced \\n90\\xa0percent recycled steel in the battery tray of MacBook Air with M2\\xa0— a first for Apple.\\nPaper For\\xa0information about our progress on paper, see our feature  on packaging.\\nTantalum Regulatory barriers  \\nAvailability and access  \\nSupply chainsWe continue to address the challenge of sourcing 100 percent recycled content at the quality \\nwe need for capacitors. We’re actively investigating recovery approaches from end-of-life \\nelectronics to develop further use of this recycled material. Based on material recovery rates, \\nour products may already contain some recycled tantalum. But, to reach our goal, we have to \\nmove beyond existing tantalum supply chains that mix primary and secondary content. This \\nrequires starting from the beginning by identifying new sources of quality tantalum scrap, then \\nbuilding traceable supply chains around exclusively recycled material so that we can verify its \\nuse in high quantities in our products.\\nPlastics Technical properties  \\nAvailability and access  \\nScaleWe use a broad range of plastics in hundreds of product components, from speakers to \\nkeycaps. Each plastic material has different performance requirements that we must maintain as \\nwe switch to recycled or renewable sources. And we continue to diligently pursue this effort. In \\n2022, we introduced more than 100 parts with an average of over 40 percent recycled plastic. \\nThese include the Apple Watch Ultra antenna lines on the housing, which use plastic from \\nbottles that have been transformed into a stronger, higher-performance material.Material Key challenges Progress Material Key challenges Progress\\nTin\\xa0 Scale With tin, we began our efforts to use recycled material on the main logic board for iPhone 6s in \\n2017, and last year we expanded to many flexible printed circuit boards across many products. \\nThis resulted in our recycled tin use increasing to 38 percent on average across all product lines \\nin 2022 — up from 30 percent in 2021. In 2023, we committed to using 100 percent recycled \\ntin soldering in all Apple-designed rigid and flexible printed circuit boards by 2025.47 As we \\ncontinue to scale use across even more components, we seek to engage an exponentially \\nincreasing number of suppliers in this effort.\\nTungsten Regulatory barriers  \\nTechnical propertiesMore than 95 percent of the tungsten used in 2022 came from recycled sources, a significant \\nmilestone from prior years. In 2022, all released iPhone models feature 99 percent recycled \\ntungsten across the entire device, and all released Apple Watch models feature 100 percent \\nrecycled tungsten across the entire device. And with the help of our disassembly robots, \\nDaisy and Dave, and our recycling machine, T az, the tungsten from our T aptic Engine can be \\nrecovered and recycled.\\nZinc Technical properties  \\nSupply chainsWe continue to work to identify high-quality sources of recycled zinc. This is a challenge \\nbecause the material is prone to accumulating impurities during the recycling process. \\nEach source that we identify is rigorously tested so that recycled materials meet our high \\nperformance standards. In March 2022, we introduced 100 percent recycled zinc for the first \\ntime in Studio Display and Mac Studio, which use it in the brass prongs of the power cord plug \\nand AC inlet.How we source materials:\\nRecycled content\\nCertified recycled content is sourced from recycled \\nmaterials that have been independently verified by \\nthird parties to a standard that conforms with ISO \\n14021. We also account for recycled content that \\nhas been confirmed by suppliers but hasn’t received \\nthird-party  verification.\\nResponsible sourcing\\nApple’s Responsible Sourcing of Materials Standard \\ncovers all primary and recycled materials. Our standard \\naligns with leading international standards, including the \\nUN’s\\xa0Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights \\nand OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible \\nSupply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and \\nHigh-Risk  Areas.2023 Environmental Progress Report  38 Climate Change Smarter Chemistry Engagement and Advocacy Appendix Introduction Resources\\nWe’re closing in on our goal to \\neliminate plastics from our packaging \\nby 2025.48 To get this far, we’ve \\naddressed many packaging \\ncomponents that typically rely on \\nplastic, including large product \\ntrays, screen films, wraps, and foam \\ncushioning, replacing each with fiber \\nalternatives. We’re now focusing on \\nimplementing innovative alternatives \\nto the small uses of plastics across \\nour packaging  — like labels and \\nlamination  — which will help us \\naddress the remaining 4 percent  of \\nplastic in Apple’s packaging footprint. \\nAt the same time, we’re taking steps \\nso that our packaging is recyclable \\nand that the fiber we source comes \\nfrom recycled sources or responsibly \\nmanaged  forests.Improving the recyclability of our packaging helps reduce \\nour overall environmental footprint. In 2022, we released \\na number of products with over 95 percent  fiber-based \\npackaging, including iPhone 14 Pro, MacBook Air with \\nM2, and iPad Air (5th generation).49\\xa0And this year, we’ve \\ncontinued this work with packaging innovations for \\niPhone, iMac, iPad, and Apple Watch to address the \\nremaining plastic in the smaller parts of our packaging  — \\nlabels and lamination.\\nTo eliminate the need for labels on the latest iPhone \\nmodels  — iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro  — we introduced \\ndigital printing directly on the back of boxes.50 We \\ndeveloped a custom high-resolution ultraviolet inkjet \\nprinter that can print on demand at the manufacturing \\nfacilities where iPhone is packaged. We estimate that \\neliminating the labels will avoid over 300 m etric tons \\nof plastic, over 150 m etric tons of paper, and over \\n3700 m etric tons of carbon emissions.51\\nWe’re also working to eliminate plastic lamination from our \\npackaging. In 2022, iPad Air (5th generation), iPad Pro, \\nand Apple Watch Series 8 replaced the polypropylene \\nplastic lamination used on boxes and packaging \\ncomponents with an overprint varnish. This varnish, \\nwhich we developed with rigorous qualification over three \\nyears, makes packaging more recyclable while retaining \\nthe design and feel that our customers expect when \\nfirst opening their product. It’s also more efficient; the \\noverprint varnish process requires a single step rather \\nthan the multiple steps needed previously. In 2022, this \\nhelped us avoid over 1100 m etric tons of plastic and over \\n2400 m etric tons of CO 2e.52\\nFEATURE\\nReducing plastic and waste \\nthrough packaging innovation\\nWe carefully developed our new overprint varnish to replace the polypropylene lamination while meeting rigorous quality standards for our packaging recyclability and aesthetic. 2023 Environmental Progress Report  39 Climate Change Smarter Chemistry Engagement and Advocacy Appendix Introduction Resources\\nWe’re also working to improve the recyclability of our \\npackaging. Apple’s packaging design guidelines factor in \\npackaging recyclability, requiring the use of fiber-based \\nmaterials that can break back down to pulp as part of \\nmixed-paper recycling streams, alongside materials \\nlike cereal boxes.53 These guidelines are supported by \\nthird-party assessments from firms  — including Western \\nMichigan University’s Paper Pilot Plant and the U.S. Forest Each of these innovations has applications for our other \\nproducts  — and potential to eliminate plastics. We intend \\nto implement these across our products to reach our goal \\nof eliminating plastics in our packaging. For example, \\noverprint varnish replaces the plastic lamination that \\naccounts for approximately half the plastics remaining in \\nour packaging.Service’s Forest Products Laboratory  — and we continue \\nto monitor evolving international packaging  standards.\\nAs we eliminate plastic in our packaging, we continue to \\nmake sure that the wood fiber comes from responsible \\nsources.

Longer-lasting devices provide our customers \\nwith options to access the value of their current device \\nthrough Apple Trade In or third-party programs. \\nCustomers can upgrade to the latest products using a \\ncredit according to their device’s trade-in value. This also \\nhelps keep products in use for as long as possible so \\nthat new customers can experience Apple products and \\nservices with refurbished devices. Making more products \\nand services available to more people is good for our \\nbusiness, and making those products last longer is better \\nfor the planet.\\nProducts that are designed to last hold their value longer. \\niPhone, for example, has the slowest depreciation rate \\namong the six leading smartphone manufacturers. And \\ncompared with flagship Android devices, iPhone holds \\nan average of 30 percent  more value over a four-year \\nbuy-back period.55 As of January 2023, iPhone 7, which \\nwas introduced in 2016, still had monetary value for Apple \\nTrade In in the United States.56\\n\\xa0We’re committed to building long-lasting devices,\\xa0and \\npart of achieving that is designing durable hardware. \\nTo\\xa0minimize products’ need for repair, we refine features \\nthat improve durability, like water resistance and Ceramic \\nShield, which protects the display on iPhone. And we \\nprovide regular software support, so customers can \\nupdate their devices to the most recent operating \\nsystems and unlock the latest features and functionality \\nyears after  purchase. \\nWe’ve also expanded access to safe, reliable, and secure \\nrepair services to meet our customers’ needs. When \\nproducts require repair, customers can more easily \\nfind repair options that work for them, such as Apple \\nAuthorized Service Providers, the Independent Repair \\nProvider program, and, starting in 2022, Apple’s Self \\nService  Repair.\\nBuilding products to last\\nOur customers use our products every day. Which is why \\nwe design our devices with the rigors of continuous use in \\nmind  —\\xa0and to minimize the interruptions of maintenance \\nand repair.\\nDurable hardware is central to our products. Engineers in \\nour Reliability Testing Lab assess our designs against our \\nstrict durability standards that measure the performance \\nof materials, components, and fully assembled products. \\nThey use testing methods that mimic realistic conditions \\nin which our customers use their products, assessing \\nmany aspects of each device.

In 2022, we sent more than \\n12.1 million devices and accessories to new owners \\nfor reuse. The Apple Trade In program, available in 25 \\ncountries, provides customers with product end-of-life \\noptions  — they can access the value of their current \\ndevice if they upgrade to a newer model, or they can \\ntrade in their device for free.Our customers drive the success of our trade-in \\nprograms and those of third parties. Customers who \\nuse these options help realize the long-term value that \\nwe’ve designed and built into our products  — whether \\nthrough trading or passing down their devices or by \\npurchasing refurbished products. Each product that‘s \\nrefurbished and reused contributes to reducing our overall \\nenvironmental  footprint.\\nSome device parts can also be reused. We’re finding \\nnew ways to access these valuable components within \\nour devices. After recovery, these parts can be used \\nto replace existing components or repurposed in new \\ncreative applications. We continue to expand the number \\nof parts that can be recovered and refurbished to our \\nhigh quality and performance standards, and reused as \\nreplacements. This enables us to reduce the need to \\ncreate spare parts as we repair devices. We also remain \\nfocused on innovation opportunities to reuse accessories \\nsent for recycling.

Our Material \\nRecovery Lab (MRL), an R2-certified facility in Austin, \\nTexas, focuses on assessing the recyclability of our \\nproducts, helping inform design decisions that support \\ndisassembly and recovery. The MRL’s work has led the \\nway in automated approaches to material recovery with \\nour robots Daisy, Dave, and Taz .\\nDaisy, our disassembly robot, is capable of quickly and \\nskillfully taking apart 23 m odels of iPhone  — including \\nvarious models between iPhone 5 and iPhone 12\\xa0— into \\ndiscrete components. This vital step helps improve \\nmaterial recovery and recycling and yields clear results. \\nFrom just one metric ton of iPhone main logic boards, \\nflexes, and camera modules recovered by Daisy, our \\nrecycling partner is capable of recovering the same \\namount of gold and copper as more than 2000 m etric \\ntons of mined rock.58\\xa0We hope other innovators follow \\nsuit. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued Apple \\nfive patents related to Daisy, and we’re willing to license \\nthese to researchers and other electronics manufacturers \\nthat are developing their own disassembly processes.59Dave, a robot specializing in disassembling the T aptic \\nEngine, enables the recovery of rare earth magnets as \\nwell as tungsten and steel. T az, which helps recycle \\nmodules by separating magnets containing rare earth \\nelements from audio modules, is designed as an \\nalternative to the conventional shredder that many \\nrecyclers rely on. While rare earth elements are typically \\nlost in conventional shredders, T az is designed to \\naccess these valuable materials, improving our overall \\nrecovery  rate.\\nWe’re also developing new technologies at our Santa \\nClara Valley, California, asset recovery center that leverage \\nautomation and machine learning to facilitate recycling \\nprocesses that typically require manual sorting, which \\ncan be time-intensive and error-prone. This work aims to \\ncreate low-cost solutions that our suppliers can deploy \\nto recover more materials, freeing up their employees for \\nmore complex tasks that can’t be easily  automated. \\nThe benefits we’re trying to achieve aren’t strictly \\nresource based. We’re also working to improve the \\nmaterial handling efforts of demanufacturing. In 2022, we \\nbegan deploying overhead projector-based augmented \\nreality systems to recyclers. This system projects \\ninstructions for demanufacturing processes onto the work \\nsurface. This innovation is designed to further\\xa0improve \\nsafety, productivity, and efficiency.Designing for the next generation of recycling\\nThe greatest opportunities for recycling are yet to \\ncome. We’re committed to a long-term approach to \\nrecycling innovation, relying on and continually improving \\ncurrent approaches while nurturing new and emerging \\ntechnologies. By fostering research and development, \\nwe can identify opportunities for transformative changes. \\nWe invest with this in mind. And we continue to support \\ninitiatives that set out to redefine disassembly and \\nmaterial  recovery.\\nWe’re investing in recycling innovations that can have \\nindustry-wide impacts. For several years, we’ve worked \\nwith Carnegie Mellon University’s Biorobotics Lab in \\nthe School of Computer Science’s Robotics Institute to \\nidentify and disassemble e-scrap. This innovation has \\nthe potential to enable recyclers to recover the materials \\nat a higher quality. The software from this project will \\nbe open source and available to others in the industry \\nthat are working to maximize the recovery of recyclable \\nmaterials. We’ve also worked with the lab to improve the \\naccuracy of disassembly and the recovery of materials \\nthrough X-ray imaging with RGB imaging. And we’re \\noptimizing our robots’ abilities to handle objects and \\nadjust to contact, enabling them to “feel” by using high-\\nfrequency force feedback and machine learning. Through \\nthis work, we’re driving toward developing truly intelligent \\ndisassembly  technology.Learn more about Apple’s \\nresearch with Carnegie \\nMellon University in our \\nwhite  paper .2023 Environmental Progress Report  46 Climate Change Smarter Chemistry Engagement and Advocacy Appendix Introduction Resources\\n \\n \\n The responsible use of natural \\nresources is a critical part of \\nApple’s environmental objectives. \\nExtracting the materials that \\nmake up our products comes with \\nsignificant environmental costs. We \\nwork to minimize these by using \\nmaterials efficiently so that we \\ncan one day build all our products \\nout of recycled or renewable \\nmaterials. This\\xa0circularity ambition \\nis an integral\\xa0part of our strategy to \\nmeet\\xa0our goal of being fully carbon \\nneutral\\xa0in 2030, including across \\nthe\\xa0lifetime use of our  products. \\nGlobal demand for electronics is increasing, and with it, \\nso is the demand for the materials that make up those \\nproducts. Awareness is growing of the finite nature of \\nsome of these resources, such as critical minerals or rare \\nearth elements  — as well as of the complex, globally \\ninterrelated nature of the supply chains that electronics \\nrely on.\\xa0Circularity plays an important role in helping \\nrealize environmental benefits while building supply chain \\nresilience. Policy can be part of the solution, helping \\ntransition from the older “take-make-dispose” linear \\nmodel to circular supply chains. This reflects changing \\ntechnologies as well as current and future demands, \\nmaking circular supply chains competitive with traditional, \\nextractive  ones. Over the last year, Apple has reached new milestones \\nin our products and our efforts to demonstrate what’s \\npossible in circularity. We’re aiming for even greater use \\nof recycled content in our products. Our commitments \\ninclude using 100 percent  recycled cobalt  — a critical \\nmineral  — in Apple-designed batteries and using \\n100 percent  recycled rare earth elements in all magnets, \\nboth by 2025.60 And advancements in recycling \\ntechnology help make this possible. For example, cobalt \\nrecovered from iPhone batteries disassembled by Daisy \\nis returned to the market. And T az  — which we developed \\nas an alternative to traditional shredders for breaking \\ndown electronics  — enables us to recover even greater \\namounts of rare earth elements. This more efficient and \\neconomical approach makes these materials available to \\nothers beyond our supply  chain.\\nWe’ve also expanded our Self Service Repair program \\nfrom iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 to include MacBook Air \\nand MacBook Pro  notebooks with the M1 family of chips. \\nThis makes repair manuals and genuine Apple parts \\nand tools available to customers through the Apple Self \\nService Repair Store. We continue to build, support, \\nand participate in circular supply chains. But challenges \\nremain to achieve fully circular electronics supply  chains. Policy can help accelerate progress. A thriving, \\nresponsible, circular economy supports critically \\nimportant health, safety, and environmental protections. It \\ncan also enable closed loop supply chains to be cost and \\noperationally competitive with linear models. Harmonized \\npolicies can remove barriers and drive the transition to \\ncircularity by meeting the following high-level  objectives: \\nSourcing and recycling materials responsibly: \\n• Policies should seek to improve strict labor, human \\nrights, and environmental standards throughout \\nrecycled and primary materials supply  chains.\\n• Circularity should be a priority for policies that aim to \\naddress sources of supply over new ways or locations \\nfor resource extraction. Recycling electronics will help \\nunlock the valuable materials in those devices for \\nreuse, reducing reliance on newly mined  resources.\\nDesigning for longevity: \\n• Policies should strive to maximize product longevity \\nwhile minimizing environmental impact, by enabling \\nthe optimal balance between designing for reliability \\nand ease of repair.\\n• Ecodesign policies are most effective in delivering \\nenvironmental benefits when they’re product-specific \\nand globally  aligned.Improving material recovery: \\n• Support the development of efficient collection \\nprograms that engage customers, protect \\nenvironmental and human health, and capture high \\nvolumes of\\xa0electronics for reuse, repair, refurbishment, \\nand recycling.\\n• Waste regulations should be consistent and \\nharmonized across geographies, enabling efficient, \\ncommercially viable movement of materials. Such \\npolicies can drive maximum materials recovery, \\nprevent downcycling, and help enable parity with \\nnewly mined resources while maintaining critical \\nenvironmental and social  protections.\\nImproving recycling: \\n• Incentivize the inclusion of recycled content in \\nproducts by supporting the generation of increased, \\nhigh-quality material supply, including improving \\nwaste collection and recycling infrastructure, the \\ndevelopment of global waste treatment standards, \\nand recycled content quality  standards.\\n• Support the development of advanced electronics \\nrecycling facilities that can recover more types of \\nresources, including materials that are difficult to \\nrecover or of lower  value.Feature\\nOur position on circular \\neconomy policy\\nApple is working to realize a circular economy through \\npolicy engagement and advocacy.\\nApple supports the ratification of the Basel Convention by \\nthe United States. This would help enable circular supply \\nchains and address some current barriers to efficient \\nmaterials recovery and reuse. The Basel Convention \\nis the global regulatory framework guiding how some \\nwaste  — including electronics and e-scrap  — can \\nbe moved for recovery, recycling, and disposal. The \\nconvention provides critical environmental and social \\nprotections, especially against moving hazardous waste \\nto geographies that lack the resources to manage it in \\nan environmentally sound manner. Countries that have \\nratified the convention can move materials covered by the \\nagreement among themselves, following the agreement’s \\nregulatory  requirements. \\nThe U.S. is one of a very small number of countries not \\nparty to the Basel Convention. This imposes restrictions \\non the movement of Basel-controlled wastes for recycling \\nor resource recovery into or from the U.S. to nearly all \\nother countries in the world, requiring specific trade \\nagreements with another country. The U.S. ratifying the \\nconvention would unlock more efficient movement of \\nmaterial to high-quality electronics recycling facilities, \\nhelping scale circularity and the available supply \\nof recycled material. It would also allow the U.S. to \\nparticipate in the global conversation around how to \\nprotect communities and environmental health and create \\nmore efficient and effective circular supply  chains.2023 Environmental Progress Report  47 Climate Change Smarter Chemistry Engagement and Advocacy Appendix Introduction Resources\\nWater\\nWater is among the planet’s most \\nprecious resources. We consider the \\nfull life cycle of water as we bring our \\nproducts and services to life. And we \\nknow that to protect this resource, \\nwe must go beyond our corporate \\nfootprint, across our supply chain and \\ninto the communities and watersheds \\nwhere we operate.\\nClimate change continues to\\xa0impact global water \\nresources  — making freshwater increasingly scarce, \\nflooding more frequent, and access more vulnerable. \\nThese effects can be felt in the communities where we \\nand our suppliers operate, which is why we’re committed \\nto managing these resources responsibly. We can do so \\nby reducing our freshwater withdrawals and returning \\nclean water to the watershed. We can limit the use of \\nfreshwater. And, where appropriate, we can rely on \\nalternative sources such as recycled water for functions \\nlike irrigation and cooling so that freshwater is available for \\npeople and  ecosystems. Water quality is another challenge. We’ve made it a \\npriority to maintain the quality of the water that we use \\nand discharge so that it will be suitable for its next use, \\ncontributing to the overall health of local  watersheds.\\nWater is a community resource, and it demands equitable \\ndistribution and access, which requires a collective \\napproach to challenges and local solutions.\\xa0This is why \\nwe’re committed to engaging watershed stakeholders \\nthrough supporting Alliance for Water Stewardship \\ncertifications for our suppliers and key corporate \\nfacilities, as well as by participating in local watershed \\nmanagement  projects. \\nWe aspire to advance water security in the places where \\nwe operate through actions that deliver on our guiding \\nprinciples of improving availability, quality, and access. \\nWe’ve aligned our approach across five strategic pillars: \\nlow-water design, site efficiency and conservation, site \\nwater stewardship, replenishment and nature-based \\nsolutions, and leadership and advocacy.Our water  strategy\\nLOW-WATER DESIGN\\nMinimize water impacts in the design of products, services, \\nand sites.\\nSITE EFFICIENCY AND CONSERVATION\\nImprove the performance of existing sites and processes.\\nSITE WATER STEWARDSHIP\\nDemonstrate responsibility beyond our facilities through \\nwatershed level  management.\\nREPLENISHMENT AND NATURE-BASED \\nSOLUTIONS\\nImprove water availability, quality, and access through \\nregenerative  approaches.\\nLEADERSHIP AND ADVOCACY\\nAdvance water management through policy, advocacy, and \\ntechnology  innovation. This strategy is informed by geographically specific \\ninsights. Resources like the World Resources Institute \\n(WRI)\\xa0Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas provide detailed insights \\non local watershed health, such as baseline water stress. \\nUnderstanding that 37 percent  of our corporate and \\nsupply chain water use is located in areas of high or \\nextreme basin stress helps inform the prioritization of \\nour efforts.61\\nWe continue to monitor and manage water use in our \\nowned-and-operated facilities, and we go beyond the \\ntypical practice in our industry by further engaging with \\nour suppliers across our manufacturing supply chain sites \\nto better understand their water use.\\xa0Only by considering \\nimpacts throughout the value chain can we achieve the \\nwater management goals that we’ve set for ourselves.2023 Environmental Progress Report  48 Climate Change Smarter Chemistry Engagement and Advocacy Appendix Introduction Resources\\nLow-water  design\\nWe approach low-water design by first focusing on site \\nselection, conducting a water risk evaluation to determine \\nwhether a potential site is in a water-stressed area or \\nnot. We aim to avoid locating water-intensive processes \\nin water-stressed locations, so we either use the results \\nto select a more appropriate site where possible, or to \\nmitigate the impact of our expected water  use.\\nThen, we look to systems and processes that use less \\nwater or reuse water, so that we can limit excess water \\nconsumption and, where possible, eliminate waste. We \\nalso design solutions to manage the quality of the water \\nthat we return to the watershed.\\nIn our corporate operations, we discharge the majority of \\nour wastewater to the sanitary sewer. Up to 44 percent  \\nof the water that we use at our corporate locations is \\ndischarged back into the local water system rather \\nthan consumed.62 We monitor the water quality \\nfrom sites where we have an industrial wastewater \\ndischarge so that each location meets or exceeds local \\ndischarge  requirements.One example is our new Capstone campus in Austin, \\nTexas, where we aim to achieve net-zero water use. \\nTo accomplish this, the campus will rely on an onsite \\nwastewater reuse system, as well as condensate recovery \\nand stormwater capture, limiting potable water use to \\npotable purposes only. This effort will avoid 60 m illion \\ngallons of freshwater use, relying instead on nonpotable \\nwater for cooling and toilet flushing.63\\xa0This cooling \\napproach will also allow us to achieve 28 m illion kWh \\nin\\xa0energy savings annually at the location.\\nIn our supply chain, a majority of water is used during \\nmanufacturing. For example, in 2019 we launched a \\npilot program at a manufacturing location in China as \\npart of our anodizing improvement program with the \\naim of reducing, and eventually eliminating, potentially \\nhazardous discharge as well as reducing water and \\nchemical use. Anodizing is the most water-intensive \\nprocess in the metal-finishing process of enclosures. \\nAs\\xa0part of the pilot, we employed several water efficiency \\napproaches, including using cascade and counterflow \\nrinsing processes, which helped retain 75 to 85 percent  \\nof the water used during metal finishing. This process \\nimprovement has the potential to save millions of gallons \\nof freshwater annually when applied at scale.\\nThe aluminum anodizing process is typically water-intensive. In 2019, we launched a pilot to seek to eliminate hazardous discharge and increase water efficiency from anodizing. \\nThe\\xa0cascade and counterflow rinsing processes, which helped retain 75 to 85 percent of the water used during metal finishing, could save millions of gallons of freshwater annually \\nwhen\\xa0applied at scale.2023 Environmental Progress Report  49 Climate Change Smarter Chemistry Engagement and Advocacy Appendix Introduction Resources\\nWater use at corporate  facilities\\nWe track our corporate water use for our data centers, retail stores, \\ndistribution centers, and corporate  offices. \\n1,527  \\nMgal\\n90%  \\nFRESHWATER\\nWe define freshwater as drinking-water quality, the \\nmajority of which comes from municipal sources and \\nless than 5 percent of which comes from groundwater.\\xa0<1%  \\nOTHER ALTERNATIVE SOURCES\\nWe also capture rainwater and recover \\ncondensate as alternative water sources for \\nuse onsite. \\n9%  \\nRECYCLED WATER\\nWe source recycled water as a key \\nalternative to freshwater and use it \\nprimarily for irrigation, cooling systems, \\nand toilet flushing. Our recycled water \\ncomes mostly from municipal treatment \\nplants, with less than 5 percent coming \\nfrom onsite treatment.Site efficiency and conservation\\nNext, we focus on identifying steps to use less freshwater \\nin our existing operations. In particular, we prioritize \\nregions where our efforts can immediately reduce stress \\non local watersheds. Our corporate and supplier sites \\nrely on water for everything from sanitation and climate \\ncontrol to maintaining green spaces and manufacturing. \\nAt each point, we seek out efficiencies and approaches to \\nreduce our freshwater  use.\\nOne challenge we’ve committed to addressing is reducing \\nwater use, even as we grow in our corporate facilities. \\nSeparating growth from water use requires dedicated \\nfocus. In 2022, our facilities used about 1. 5 billion  gallons \\nof water in our direct operations, a 9 percent  increase \\nfrom 2021. Some of this growth reflects the return \\nto office from the COVID pandemic, but most of the \\nincrease was driven by corresponding growth in our data \\ncenter cooling loads. We expect currently implemented \\nimprovements in water use effectiveness (WUE) and new \\ndry cooling designs at our data centers to decouple water \\nuse from electricity  use.\\nLast year, alternative water sources accounted for about \\n10 percent  of our total corporate water usage  — primarily \\nfrom municipal recycled water sources. At Apple locations \\nin Texas, North Carolina, Ireland, T aiwan, and Japan, \\nwe used rainwater capture systems to source 3 million \\ngallons of water; from our newly installed condensate \\nrecovery systems in Santa Clara Valley, Austin, and North \\nCarolina, we captured 1. 5 million gallons of condensate \\nin 2022. Through our low-water design and site efficiency \\nand conservation efforts, we saved 152 m illion gallons of \\nfreshwater in 2022 from projects implemented since 2017.64These efforts start at the local level. In Santa Clara Valley, \\nCalifornia, where our corporate headquarters are located, \\nwe’ve pursued water conservation across our landscaping \\nefforts. This includes six new projects in 2022, saving \\n1.2 million gallons of water. We intend to expand this work \\nto an additional 16 conservation projects in 2023.\\nAt our data centers, we’ve upgraded and replaced servers \\nto reduce our cooling water usage by 60 m illion gallons \\nannually. We’ve also piloted a resin water treatment \\nsystem that resulted in a 30 percent  reduction in makeup \\nwater use and up to 60 percent  reduction in discharge.65 \\nBased on this success, we are implementing this \\ntechnology at our data centers in Prineville, Oregon, and \\nMesa, Arizona. Additionally, we piloted a plant-based \\nwater treatment using sustainably harvested sphagnum \\nmoss at several data centers, helping eliminate the need \\nfor biocides and corrosion inhibitors. This system, which \\nuses compostable, natural sphagnum moss to improve \\nwater quality, can further improve water savings. We \\nimplemented this at our Reno, Nevada, data center and \\nhave begun permanent installations in Maiden, North \\nCarolina, and Mesa,  Arizona.\\nWe’re also expanding our efforts to recover water \\nthat’s otherwise wasted. Six new condensate recovery \\ninstallations  — including four in Santa Clara Valley \\nand installations at our new Capstone campus in \\nAustin, Texas, and at our Maiden, North Carolina, data \\ncenter  — harvest excess water from cooling systems to \\nbe redirected to cooling towers and for landscaping use \\nthat would otherwise be discharged.We also require our suppliers to maintain the high \\nstandards for water discharge outlined in the Apple \\nSupplier Code of Conduct. Through Apple’s Clean \\nWater Program, we help suppliers minimize process \\nwater impacts and adopt best practices in wastewater \\ntreatment. We make our expectations clear to our \\nsuppliers and help define operational approaches so that \\nthey have the support needed to achieve their optimal \\nlevel of water efficiency and conservation. There’s a \\nclear business imperative to develop these practices, \\nparticularly in manufacturing and production where water \\nis critical for power generation, cleaning, and cooling \\nprocesses. Water scarcity around the world requires that \\nwe focus on shifting this program away from voluntary \\nengagement. We’re working to incorporate water \\nrequirements into our procurement decision-making so \\nthat supplier engagement scales  faster.\\nOur supply chain accounts for 99 percent  of our total \\nwater footprint, based on our detailed water inventory. \\nThat’s why we partner closely with our suppliers through \\nour Clean Water Program. Since the program’s launch in \\n2013, m ore than 234\\xa0participating supplier sites increased \\ntheir average reuse rate to 42 percent  and saved our \\nsuppliers 13 billion  gallons of freshwater in 2022, for a \\ntotal of over 63 billion  gallons of water savings.66 These \\nsavings come from a range of initiatives, such as reuse of \\nreclaimed water, upgrades to water-efficient equipment, \\nand countercurrent rinse  methods.2023 Environmental Progress Report  50 Climate Change Smarter Chemistry Engagement and Advocacy Appendix Introduction Resources\\nSite water  stewardship\\nWe look beyond our operations and those of our suppliers \\nto address shared water challenges. This involves \\nengaging with the communities around our facilities for \\nthe protection of local watersheds. Since 2018, we’ve \\npartnered with the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) \\nto advance the AWS Standard, the first global framework \\nto measure responsible water stewardship across social, \\ncultural, environmental, and economic criteria. In 2020, \\nApple joined the AWS board of trustees with the objective \\nof highlighting water stewardship opportunities to our \\nsuppliers and promoting collective action on shared water \\nchallenges with the Information and Communications \\nTechnology  sector.\\nThrough AWS, we’ve been able to certify facilities \\nthat meet the AWS Standard, considering benefits \\nand recognizing impacts to local water catchments, \\ncommunities, and ecosystems. Our Prineville, Oregon, \\ndata center was the first facility of its kind to receive \\nAWS certification in 2021. In January 2023, our Reno, \\nNevada, and Mesa, Arizona, data centers also achieved \\ncertification. We are on track to certify all of our owned \\nand operated data centers by 2025.\\nSince 2018, 17 of our supplier sites have achieved \\ncertification for the AWS Standard, 15 of which achieved \\na Platinum rating  — the highest score achievable within \\nthe AWS framework. In January 2022, Suzhou Industrial \\nPark  — with the help of Apple and other partners  — \\nbecome the first industrial park in the world to earn the \\nAWS  certification.We’re also active in the communities where our facilities \\nare located. In Prineville, we supported the Deschutes \\nLand Trust in the protection of the Ochoco Preserve, \\nwhich is situated at the confluence of the Ochoco and \\nMcKay creeks  — a major salmon and steelhead trout \\nhabitat in the Crooked River basin. In Reno, Nevada, and \\nthe surrounding areas, we continue to partner with The \\nNature Conservancy for restoration and clean-up efforts \\nof natural habitats along the Truckee  River.\\nReplenishment and \\nnature-based  solutions\\nA key element to addressing water availability, quality, \\nand access is replenishment efforts and nature-based \\napproaches to restoring watersheds. Our goal is to \\nreplenish our corporate freshwater withdrawals in high \\nstress locations. This work is underway with some \\nkey projects.\\nIn partnership with the Bonneville Environmental \\nFoundation, we’re funding the removal of the invasive \\nArundo donax  cane species in the San Fernando Valley \\narea of the Los Angeles River watershed. This plant \\nspecies monopolizes space, sunlight, and water, displacing \\nwildlife and stressing local watersheds. This removal effort \\naddresses water availability in the watershed that feeds \\nthe greater Los Angeles area and will deliver 55 m illion \\ngallons of replenished water  annually.\\nIn 2018, we partnered with the City of Prineville to develop \\nan aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) system. The ASR \\nsystem pumps water during the winter off-peak months from the large aquifer that underlies Prineville, treats the \\nwater, and then conveys it uphill to a smaller local aquifer. \\nIn the summer, this stored water is pumped to meet our \\ncooling needs so that our water usage doesn’t affect \\ncity water supplies. This response to seasonal variability \\nhelps provide water security and drought resilience for \\nthe region.\\nWe’re also engaged with the Uptime Catalyst Facility \\nin India, one of our key corporate locations with water, \\nsanitation, and hygiene (WASH) challenges,\\xa0to introduce \\nan innovative performance-based program that allows \\nclean, cold water to be more widely distributed and \\nmaintained. This will generate a volumetric water benefit \\nannually, equivalent to our direct operations freshwater \\nwithdrawal in India.67\\nLeadership and advocacy\\nOur work on water affords us another opportunity: to \\nlead with others and push for change across industries. \\nWe collaborate with groups, including AWS and the \\nResponsible Business Alliance (RBA), and speak \\nto audiences that are in a position to impact their \\ncommunities and industries. In May 2022, we addressed \\nthe AWS Global Water Stewardship Forum in Edinburgh to \\ndiscuss our stewardship strategy supply chain. In October \\n2022, we addressed the RBA’s annual conference in \\nSanta Clara, California, with AWS to promote collective \\naction on key catchment identification in the ICT sector in \\norder to further accelerate supplier participation in water \\nstewardship efforts, including supplier hubs in priority \\nwater  basins.In 2022, we partnered with Frank Water in India to \\ndevelop and implement a water resource management \\nplan through a community-based WASH grant that \\nfocuses on increasing water stewardship through \\nimproving decision making around water and climate \\nresilience. Frank Water works alongside local partners so \\nthat safe water, sanitation, and hygiene are within reach \\nfor communities experiencing challenges in accessing \\nwater resources. And in 2023, we joined the UN Water \\nConference to speak to the importance of corporate \\nleadership on water, emphasizing the importance of \\nsupply chain  actions. \\nWe also take positions on issues that matter to us and \\nwhere we can try to make a difference. We’re engaging \\nwith the development of the next phase of Volumetric \\nWater Benefit Accounting methodology with the WRI and \\nothers to further the replenishment and nature-based \\nsolutions  industry.2023 Environmental Progress Report  51 Climate Change Smarter Chemistry Engagement and Advocacy Appendix Introduction Resources\\nZero waste\\nAll waste that gets sent to landfill \\ncomes with costs. These can be \\nmeasured in the resources and \\nemissions that go into discarded \\nmaterials. And, too often, the most \\nvulnerable communities around \\nthe world carry a disproportionate \\nburden of these costs and others \\nassociated with waste disposal. We’re \\nworking to change this by prioritizing \\nwaste-free operations at our own \\nfacilities as well as those of our \\nmanufacturing  suppliers.\\nAt our offices, retail locations, data centers, and \\nconstruction sites, we’re implementing systems and \\napproaches to avoid sending waste to landfill. We’re \\nasking our manufacturing suppliers to do the same. \\nOur focus is on eliminating waste generated during \\nmanufacturing and engaging with local specialty recyclers \\nand composters to redirect materials from landfills.\\xa0This \\nrequires innovation and collaboration with local partners \\nto make the best use of our resources. We measure our \\nprogress in the amount of waste that we divert at the \\nsource and by our ability to protect the communities \\nwhere we and our suppliers  operate.Reducing waste at our \\ncorporate  facilities\\nWe’re reducing the amount of waste generated in our \\ncorporate operations and directing more to recycling \\nprograms  — an effort that has continued since launching \\nour Zero Waste Program in 2018. Initially we focused on \\nU.S. campuses and retail locations. Since then, we’ve \\ngrown in the U.S. and around the world while remaining \\ncommitted to sending zero waste to landfill.\\nIn 2022, recycling and composting efforts allowed us to \\nachieve a waste diversion rate of 71 percent  — up from \\n68 percent  in 2021  — limiting landfill waste from our \\nglobal operations to about\\xa016, 000 m etric tons.68\\xa0Despite \\noccupancy increases during our transition from COVID-\\nrelated temporary closures, our overall waste generated \\nremained  low.\\xa0\\nWe haven’t interrupted our efforts to make progress \\non waste diversion since achieving our first zero-waste \\ncertification, UL’s Zero Waste to Landfill validation, in \\n2015 for our campus in Cork, Ireland. In 2023, our\\xa0T aiwan \\nTechnology Center became the second Apple facility \\nto receive the UL Solutions Zero Waste to Landfill \\nvalidation.69 And our data center in Viborg, Denmark, \\nbecame the third facility to receive TRUE certification \\nin 2023, joining our data centers in Mesa, Arizona, and \\nPrineville, Oregon.70 These facilities achieved TRUE \\nPlatinum, the highest certification level. TRUE recognizes \\nfacilities that divert more than 90 percent  of waste \\nfor recycling, compost, or reuse. To accomplish this, \\nwe improved waste separation through infrastructure \\nupgrades and moved away from single-use materials to reusable alternatives. These certifications also reflect \\nefforts working and coordinating with local partners, from \\ncomposters to specialty recyclers capable of handling \\nspecific waste streams, like plastic wraps and foams. By \\npartnering with these providers, we’re able to support the \\nlocal economies engaging in recycling and composting as \\nan alternative to municipal waste disposal  programs.\\nPromoting material reuse, composting, and \\nwaste diversion across our corporate and \\nretail  locations\\nAs our company grows and changes, we’ve prioritized \\nfinding opportunities to recycle construction and \\ndemolition waste. In 2022, we achieved a waste \\ndiversion rate of 83 percent  — approximately \\n23,500 m etric tons  — from corporate office and data \\ncenter construction and demolition projects through \\nrecycling and source separation efforts.\\xa0We expanded \\nsource separation efforts for our corporate office and \\ndata center construction projects  — from 7. 2 percent  \\nparticipation in 2021 to 36 percent  across projects \\nin 2022. The locations using this approach saw a \\n10 percent  higher overall diversion rate. An example of \\nthe effectiveness of source separation is our new office \\nin Battersea Power Station in London, United Kingdom. \\nOur team there achieved a 98 percent  diversion rate of \\nconstruction waste, including 300 tons of drywall, one-\\nfifth of which was directed to agricultural uses such as \\nmushroom cultivation and farming. The project reused \\ntimber onsite and donated key construction materials, \\nincluding plasterboard, for local uses. The location also \\nrecycled personal protective equipment used during \\nconstruction and build-out. \\nIn 2023, our Viborg, Denmark, facility became the third to receive TRUE Platinum certification, which requires more \\nthan 90 percent of waste from a facility to be recycled, composted, or redirected for reuse. 2023 Environmental Progress Report  52 Climate Change Smarter Chemistry Engagement and Advocacy Appendix Introduction Resources\\nWe also focus on using less so that we reduce the \\nwaste to be recycled or sent to landfill. By identifying \\nsignificant sources of waste  — like packaging materials \\nand commonly used equipment  — and then working \\nwith our suppliers, we’ve found bulk packaging solutions \\nand recyclable and reusable alternatives. Across our \\ndata center sites, we’re switching to reusable air filters. \\nPreviously, there were no off-the-shelf reusable air filters \\navailable for our application. In 2019, we partnered with \\nan industry-leading automotive filtration and technology \\ncompany to design a sustainable solution that met very \\nspecific design criteria for our design centers. And more \\nthan 38,000 reusable high-performance air filters  — \\nwhich are available for other companies to use  — have \\nbeen placed in Apple-managed facilities worldwide to \\ndate. By replacing disposable air filters with reusable \\nones, we avoid landfilling 25 tons of dirty filters each year. \\nFurther, the reusable air filters are more energy efficient, \\nleading to 35 percent  savings in fan energy use. And we \\nintend to rely exclusively on reusable filters at data centers \\nfrom here on  out. \\nWe’re working to keep waste that’s unavoidable out of \\nlandfills. This requires sorting items correctly to redirect \\nwaste to recycling and composting where possible. To \\nenable this, we make clearly labeled containers available \\nthroughout our locations. For example, we’re working \\nto reduce contamination and increase recycling rates \\nby continuing to roll out consolidated bins for recycling, \\ncomposting, and landfill and by improving signage. We \\nrecycle paper, plastic, aluminum, and cardboard materials \\nat most of our corporate and retail sites worldwide.\\xa0And \\nmore than 450 of our corporate offices, retail stores, and data centers are participating in composting. We’re \\nalso using technology to improve our diversion rates at \\ncorporate locations. At our offices in Santa Clara Valley \\nand Culver City, California, we piloted waste sensor \\ntechnology, a system that employs cameras and data \\ncollection within dumpsters to monitor contamination \\nand increase diversion efficiency. The data provides \\ncollectors with accurate information on volume to inform \\nscheduling of pickups and the use of appropriately sized \\nhauling  containers.\\nWe remain committed to the safe and responsible \\nmanagement of hazardous waste. So that wastes \\nare treated, recycled, or incinerated according to \\nsafety and environmental standards in the U.S., Apple \\nperforms audits of treatment, storage, and disposal \\nfacilities (TSDFs), with 12 performed in 2022. We \\ncontinually reevaluate the facilities used for disposal and \\nmanagement of hazardous and regulated wastes, working \\nto assess disposal method, availability, economics, \\nand sustainability. \\nDriving solutions internally through \\ncommunication, reporting, and  education\\nOur employees are one of our best resources in achieving \\nour zero-waste goals. They play a critical role in reporting \\non waste and facilitating waste audits at our locations. We \\nsupport these efforts with training, education, and access \\nto resources. In 2022, we standardized waste reporting \\nrequirements across all our data centers and corporate \\noffices and implemented a centralized dashboard system. \\nOur retail auditing program examined 13 locations in \\nNorth America, documenting the material characteristics of our waste. This data will allow for better assessment \\nof our waste practices and opportunities to improve our \\napproaches. We also launched site-specific zero-waste \\ntraining for all Apple data centers. All new data center \\nemployees are now required to complete the site-specific \\nzero-waste training and receive manager approval of \\ncompletion. Finally, we’ve standardized signage at our \\ndata centers with contextual signs for logistics and \\noperations, as well as for office and administrative  sites.\\nTaking a zero-waste approach \\nwith\\xa0our  suppliers \\nWe’re committed to leaving no waste behind in the \\ncommunities where we build our products. Our suppliers, \\nrecyclers, and waste solution providers are central to \\nachieving this goal. We’re working with them to eliminate \\nwaste from our manufacturing processes. Since we \\nlaunched the Zero Waste Program for our manufacturing \\npartners in 2015, we’ve continued to make considerable \\nprogress. And this program has expanded to include \\nmore than 300 supplier facilities across 14 countries \\nand regions.\\nIn 2022, we shifted our Zero Waste Program from an \\nopt-in effort for suppliers to a requirement as part of our \\nSupplier Code of Conduct.\\xa0This means that suppliers \\nare now required to implement a systematic approach to \\nidentifying all sources of waste and characterizing each \\nstream in the waste inventory, developing a program or \\nsolution to quantify and monitor their waste-to-landfill \\ndiversion rate, setting waste-minimization goals, and \\nmaintaining progress toward achieving zero waste to landfill. Our Zero Waste Program provides training and \\ntools to help suppliers track their waste, set waste-\\nminimization goals, and create improvement plans toward \\nachieving zero waste for their  operations. \\nWe make available to all facilities participating in the \\nprogram resources and guidance on how to reduce \\nwaste and then reuse, recycle, or compost the waste they \\ndo create. Suppliers at these locations can also access \\ntools to improve waste management and, in some cases, \\nonsite support. The program is making an impact: In \\n2022, suppliers redirected 523, 000 m etric tons of waste \\nfrom landfills (up from 491, 000 m etric tons the previous \\nyear), bringing the total to 2. 5 million metric tons since \\nthe program’s inception  — the equivalent of eliminating \\n3.1 million square meters of landfill space. Throughout \\n2022, 100 percent  of established final assembly sites  — \\nincluding for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, AirPods, \\nHomePod, Apple TV, and Beats  — maintained zero-\\nwaste-to-landfill operations.71\\xa0\\nAnd we’re working on the next challenge in achieving \\nzero waste, which is a level deeper into the subassembly \\nmodule suppliers who assemble the individual \\ncomponents that make up Apple products. The \\nwaste stream at this level is often more complex than \\nfinal assembly sites, but we’re making progress. This \\nyear, module suppliers  — including core technology \\nsuppliers  — that are participating in the Zero Waste \\nProgram increased by 50 percent . Eliminating landfill \\nwaste across these sites marks both a significant effort \\nand an achievement, diverting more than 357, 000 m etric \\ntons of waste from  landfills.150\\nOver 150 Apple \\nsupplier facilities are \\nzero-waste  verified.\\n2.5M\\n2.5 million metric tons of \\nwaste were redirected from \\nlandfill by supplier facilities \\nas part of Apple’s Zero \\nWaste \\xa0Program.2023 Environmental Progress Report  53 Climate Change Smarter Chemistry Engagement and Advocacy Appendix Introduction Resources\\nGetting to zero through  innovation\\nInnovation plays a significant role in advancing progress \\ntoward zero waste within our supply chain. We use novel \\nrecycling strategies and approaches to divert greater \\nquantities of waste from landfill in our supplier facilities at \\neven greater rates. But we also pursue material solutions \\nto impact the waste streams coming into these facilities \\nto simplify and maximize the recyclable content that our \\nsuppliers work  with.\\nWe’ve partnered with our suppliers and local businesses \\nto create new recycling options and develop opportunities \\nfor material reuse. Recycling and reuse provide \\nenvironmental benefits and can help our suppliers \\nincrease material efficiency while reducing the costs \\nassociated with material waste. At final assembly supplier \\nsites, more of our suppliers use the recyclable and \\nreusable alternatives that we helped develop for key \\nsources of waste. In particular, our Recyclable Protective \\nFilms (RPFs) that protect products during manufacturing \\nand the reusable trays used to deliver modules safely \\nthrough assembly sites have helped our suppliers \\nreduce  waste.We’ve also achieved reductions by developing thinner \\nstretch wrapping film used on pallets for final product \\npackaging. This wrapping film is a significant portion of \\nthe virgin plastic usage in our supply chain. The thinner \\nfilm reduces the amount of plastic needed by up to \\n50 percent . We’ve shared the formula for our proprietary \\nthinner stretch film with our suppliers’ current wrapping \\nfilm vendors to help accelerate its adoption while \\nproducing stronger wrapping films for product  packaging.\\nAnother opportunity for waste reduction is to decrease \\nthe amount of plastic tape used on our production lines  — \\nand to develop a stronger paper tape that can act as an \\nalternative. An audit of our production processes showed \\nthat the plastic tape used to secure parts before assembly \\nis often mixed with paper tape, making it difficult to sort \\nand divert from landfill to a recycling process. And in many \\ncases, the plastic tape wasn’t needed. We found that for \\n75 percent  of the parts secured with plastic tape, paper \\ntape could perform equally well. We then worked with \\nan industry-leading tape producer with the technology \\nto produce a strong, lower-cost paper alternative. This \\nnew paper tape alternative was put to use for 200 parts, \\neliminating 1200 m etric tons of virgin plastic from our \\nwaste  streams.Engaging with suppliers to reduce  waste\\nWe work closely with our suppliers to realize our zero-\\nwaste goals. This work faces a range of challenges, \\nincluding a lack of access to recycling technologies, \\nthe absence of local infrastructure, and the lower value \\nof recyclable material that impacts the economics of \\nrecycling. We engage with our suppliers to address these \\nchallenges through knowledge sharing. The\\xa0Waste to \\nResource database that we designed provides access \\nto available technologies and local recyclers that we’ve \\ncollected from the suppliers that we work with. The \\ndatabase provides information on more than 1000 \\nresources across more than 177 cities in China, Thailand, \\nand Vietnam\\xa0— a number that grows as we and our \\nsuppliers share valuable resources through the database. \\nAs more of our suppliers achieve their zero-waste goals, \\nwe’re able to learn and share more information. We plan \\nto make this resource public for the benefit of the entire \\nelectronics  industry.\\nReducing waste is an ongoing collaboration between us \\nand our suppliers and recycling vendors. We’re actively \\nsharing best practices and innovative approaches to \\nreduce waste; and we’re matching our suppliers with \\ncapable recycling technologies that help eliminate waste \\nthroughout the process of manufacturing our products.\\nOne example of this is a tool developed by Apple and \\nUL Solutions, our partner that validates zero-waste \\nefforts. The tool provides the first-ever supply chain \\nzero-waste management system assurance program, which allows for third-party zero-waste verification at a \\nsystems level rather than at a site level. The assurance \\nprocedure has allowed us to accelerate the verification \\nprocess significantly and establishes a new model that \\ncompanies across industries can employ to verify zero-\\nwaste programs at scale. This streamlined approach has \\nbrought even more suppliers into our program, with more \\nthan 150 validated in 2022  — a 50 percent  increase from \\nthe previous year.72\\nWe also provide support for our suppliers in verifying their \\nzero-waste efforts. The foundation of our Zero Waste \\nProgram since launch has been following the UL 2799 \\nZero Waste to Landfill Environmental Claim Validation \\nProcedure (ECVP), which requires at least 90 percent  \\ndiversion through methods other than waste-to-energy. \\nThrough this standard, our supplier facilities can certify \\nagainst clear benchmarks for waste diversion, including \\nPlatinum, Gold, and Silver levels of verification. We’ve \\nspent the last seven years expanding this program \\nthroughout our supply chain, with suppliers in China, \\nIndia, and Vietnam becoming UL validated. In 2022, \\nThailand joined that list when a local Apple supplier \\nbecame the first\\xa0in the country to receive UL 2799 \\nZWTL Gold validation. Since we switched from individual \\nsite verification to system-level verification, suppliers \\nparticipating in the assurance program can easily \\napply their verification statements from UL.\\xa0Following \\nthe switch, many suppliers maintained their individual \\ncertification for their own  purposes. 2023 Environmental Progress Report  54 Climate Change Smarter Chemistry Engagement and Advocacy Appendix Introduction Resources\\nEach space that we build presents \\nan opportunity to realize the type of \\nworld we’d like to live in  — one that’s \\ninclusive and accessible, reflects \\nthe value we place on creativity \\nand innovation, and furthers our \\nenvironmental goals.

That number grows each year as we \\ndevelop more than 17 m illion square feet of green building \\nspace  globally.\\nOur global footprint requires that we adapt to the needs of \\ndifferent locations and climates while pursuing our overall \\nobjectives. In 2022, four Apple sites in the U.S. and China \\nearned LEED Gold certification. One example is for the \\nconstruction of a corporate facility in California, where we \\nachieved an 80 percent  diversion rate for construction \\nmaterials  — 15 percent  more than the average diversion \\nrate typically observed in this region  — by separating \\nthe majority of recovered materials and sending them \\nto local specialty recyclers. We sourced FSC-certified \\nwood for 98 percent  of the wood used in this project. \\nAnd 50 percent  of its structural materials were sourced \\nfrom regional manufacturers, less than 500 m iles away, \\nminimizing material transport by using local  suppliers.We bring a similar environmental approach to our retail \\nstore development. In Vancouver, Canada, we reopened \\nApple Pacific Centre, nearly doubling the previous \\nstore’s size while reimagining features and elements \\nto incorporate the location as a creative hub for the \\ncommunity. The design drew from the local landscape \\nand ecosystem, including a facade surrounded by \\n10 m agnolia trees sourced from the Pacific Northwest. \\nThe store’s exterior is framed by a living wall spanning \\nmore than 40 feet and featuring 144 species of locally \\nsourced plants. Designed to stay lush throughout the \\nyear, the living wall promotes bee and insect habitats \\nand naturally absorbs heat and traffic noise.

These \\nchoices directly impact the safety, \\nrecyclability, and reuse of our \\nproducts, which are key to truly \\ncircular supply  chains. Smarter chemistry is our approach to identifying \\nchemicals that best serve all our priorities, including \\nsafety, performance, and environmental impact. This \\nsupports our circular supply chain efforts by minimizing \\nthe recirculation of potentially harmful substances. Our \\nefforts to remove potentially harmful chemicals from \\nour products help create safer and healthier workplaces \\nfor our employees and suppliers, and safe products for \\npeople and the  environment. \\nOur approach to limiting potential chemical exposure \\nin product manufacturing leverages the hierarchy of \\ncontrols. The hierarchy of controls is a concept used to \\ncontrol hazard exposure and consists of five actions in \\norder of preference: elimination, substitution, engineering \\ncontrols, administrative controls, and personal protective \\nequipment (PPE). Elimination and substitution are the \\nmost preferred forms of control. When no alternative is \\navailable to eliminate or substitute potential exposure, \\nwe rely on engineering and administrative controls \\nto safeguard against it. As we focus on this for our \\nmanufacturing processes, we push our industry to do \\nthe same. \\nWe’ve taken the important initial step of accounting for \\nthe materials that we use, both in our products and in \\nthe processes to create them. This information helps \\nus better protect the people who design, make, use, \\nand recycle our devices. It also informs our efforts to protect the environment. We’re working side by side with \\nleading members of the scientific community, NGOs, and \\nindustry organizations to move forward, and we continue \\nto push for the development and broad adoption of \\nsafer  alternatives.\\nOur approach involves proactively promoting the use \\nof smarter materials and chemicals. This involves \\nestablishing safety requirements that often exceed local \\nindustry standards and empowering our suppliers to meet \\nour guidelines. We also help suppliers source materials \\nthat are safer alternatives, which provide the necessary \\nlevel of performance and are also better for people \\nand the environment. We have created standards and \\nprograms to\\xa0support these efforts, including the rigorous \\nrequirements defined in our Regulated Substances \\nSpecification (RSS) and the deep supply chain \\nengagement through our Full Material Disclosure (FMD) \\nand Chemical Safety Disclosure (CSD) programs. We also \\nshare what we’ve learned in creating these systems with \\nothers in the industry  — and we push for change that can \\ntransform product  manufacturing.\\nAdvocacy and leadership are needed to make this \\nhappen.

Through \\ncollaboration, we can build a \\ncomprehensive view of the chemicals \\nin the materials that we use and \\ndrive improvements in how we make \\nour products.\\nSeveral Apple programs support these efforts. Our FMD \\nprogram maps the materials and their chemistries in our \\nproducts, while our CSD program tracks the materials \\nused to manufacture our products. We drive our supply \\nchain partners to collect in-depth information on the \\nchemicals they use, including the purpose for their use, \\nthe amount consumed, and how the chemicals are being \\napplied, stored, and handled. We also work closely with \\nour partners to review the steps being taken to protect \\ntheir  employees.We have criteria for the performance needs, \\nenvironmental impact, and safety of the materials that \\nwe use. Our goal is to identify material chemistries that \\nmeet these standards. We examine the effects of material \\nchemistries across a product’s life  — from design and \\nmanufacturing to the customer experience and, ultimately, \\nrecycling and recovery. Through early engagement \\nand effective data collection, we’re able to develop a \\ncomprehensive view of each material, and its chemistry, \\nin\\xa0support of our health and environmental  goals.\\nWe’re leading in these efforts. With our partners, \\nwe’re engaged in the work required to understand the \\nchemical composition of the materials in our products, \\nas well as the chemicals and materials used during \\nmanufacturing. Close collaboration with our partners \\nallows us to account for the materials used across our \\nsupply chain. This information informs our decisions \\nwhen it comes to health and environmental risks. The \\nway that we effectively collaborate with our partners can \\nhelp others in our industry take their own steps toward \\neliminating potentially harmful chemicals in their products \\nand manufacturing processes. This progress across our \\nindustry supports our effort to build responsible circular \\neconomies at scale.Product design\\nApple uses our Regulated Substance \\nSpecification to drive our internal teams \\nand supply chain partners to select \\nmaterials that meet our requirements.\\nProduct use\\nCustomers use products \\nmade with smarter \\nmaterials.Manufacturing\\nApple requires suppliers to manage \\nmaterials and chemicals and helps \\nthem switch to safer alternatives.Recycling\\nRecyclers can recover \\nmaterials that are safer \\nfor use in new products.Smarter chemistry matters at ever y stage  \\nin the product life  cycleBuilding a comprehensive view \\nof\\xa0the materials in our products\\nGood data is fundamental to delivering safer products. \\nWe rely on detailed and comprehensive information to \\ninform our decision-making on material chemistries. The \\nFMD program, launched six years ago, is integral to this \\nprocess. It aims to catalog and map each chemical in the \\nmaterials used in our products. Material manufacturers \\nare at the center of these efforts. They provide thorough \\nreporting on material compositions from deep within our \\nsupply chain  — proprietary data that’s shared through \\nour innovative and secure data collection system. This \\nsystem enables us to make informed choices about \\nthe materials that are used. For iPhone, iPad, and Mac \\nproducts released in 2022, we collected detailed \\nchemical information of 91 percent  of each product \\nby mass, on average. For the Apple Studio Display, we \\ncollected information on more than 93 percent  of the \\nproduct by mass.\\nOur suppliers are required to participate in the program. \\nCollectively, they share information on thousands of \\nmaterials used to manufacture our products. To make \\nthis process easier, we’ve implemented an advanced \\ncollection system for suppliers with access to a library of \\nmore than\\xa047, 000 m aterials, which have been researched \\nand validated by Apple. Our suppliers use this materials \\nlibrary to select the materials they use in our products.

We prioritize \\nhigh volume materials and those that come under \\nprolonged skin contact  — for which we look closely \\nat biocompatibility. The program helps address a \\nchallenge faced across our industry: the lack of visibility \\ninto the chemical composition of materials. To reduce \\npotential\\xa0toxicological risk and pursue opportunities to \\ndevelop better chemistries, we need deep knowledge \\nof the materials that\\xa0are used. Through the program, \\nwe’re able to identify these opportunities to improve and \\ncontribute to our health and environmental  goals.\\nThe comprehensive materials library helps inform \\ndecisions across our product life cycles. It drives better \\nmaterial selections by our supply chain partners through \\nthe RSS, and it provides a foundation for assessing \\nthe materials that we specify, how our products are \\nmanufactured, and, eventually, how they’ll be recycled. \\nWe’re using innovative approaches to this process, \\nincluding machine learning to digitize data from chemical \\ntests so this information can be more easily assessed. \\nAnd we’re finding ways to share this information by \\nsupporting the development of industry standards that \\nwill help encourage the exchange of data on materials. \\nThese efforts support our goals of improving the safety \\nof our products and the broader electronics industry \\nand beyond.Understanding chemical \\ningredients  leads to better \\nmaterials for Apple products.\\nThrough the FMD program, Apple \\nmanufacturing partners share the materials \\nused to manufacture Apple  products.\\nApple works with material manufacturers to \\nunderstand the chemistries of the materials to \\nenable  evaluation.Mapping chemicals throughout \\nproduct development leads to \\nthe use of safer materials in \\nthe manufacturing process.Comprehensive chemical  mapping\\nData helps Apple suppliers \\nmanage chemicals and \\nmaterials  when making \\nApple products.\\nInformation on how chemicals are used, \\nhow they’re stored, and how employees are \\nprotected is shared with Apple by suppliers \\nthrough our CSD  program.\\nCSD data informs and prioritizes supplier \\nengagement, encouraging rigorous chemical \\nmanagement practices and adoption of \\nsafer  alternatives.Apple customers benefit  \\nfrom using products made \\nwith safer materials and \\nchemicals.\\nThe FMD and CSD programs help support \\nthe creation of best-in-class products in a \\nresponsible manner for our customers.Creating an inventory of chemicals \\nused in manufacturing\\nWe prioritize the health and safety of the people in our \\nsupply chain.

In 2022, we continued to expand the scope of \\nbiocompatibility testing beyond individual materials to \\ninclude modules and whole products. Through this work, \\nwe have an even more comprehensive view of each \\nmaterial\\xa0and the impact that assembly has on safety. \\nWe perform toxicological analysis of the materials in our \\nproducts to help guide our material safety guidelines. The \\ninformation that we share through material specifications \\nbenefits our suppliers and those that we collaborate with \\nin the industry.\\nCreating a list of safer  cleaners\\nWe’re making an immediate impact in our efforts to \\nprotect human health and the environment through our \\napproach to the application of cleaners and degreasers. \\nThese substances account for some of the highest-\\nuse materials at final assembly sites. Regulators and \\nenvironmental health and safety organizations have \\nfocused considerable attention on the chemistries of \\ncleaners and degreasers. We’re investing in the due \\ndiligence required to identify preferred alternatives for use \\nby suppliers and others in the industry.We now proactively provide our suppliers with a list of \\ncleaners and degreasers that are safer to use. In 2022, \\nwe approved 58 safer cleaners for use in our supply \\nchain, bringing the total number of safer cleaners we’ve \\napproved over the past three years to 133. Each of these \\ncleaners has gone through a rigorous independent \\nassessment against a comprehensive set of criteria.\\nOur efforts have had a direct impact on health and \\nsafety  — and they have the potential to change how \\nour industry operates. We’re promoting the use of safer \\nalternatives for process chemicals in our supply chain \\nby making it easier for suppliers to select preferred \\nsubstitutions from the start. All our final assembly sites \\nhave used only safer alternative cleaners and degreasers, \\nas defined by Apple, since 2018. We’ve since expanded \\nthis work to the component manufacturers who create \\nmodules used in final assembly, helping them identify and \\nimplement opportunities to use safer alternatives in their \\noperations. In 2020 and 2021, we received the EPA Safer \\nChoice Partner of the Year Award for our work to scale the \\nuse of safer process chemicals and protect those working \\nin our supply  chain.\\nWe’re also looking outside our own supply chain to \\npromote a broader transition to safer chemicals.\\xa0See \\npage 66  for more about how we’re advocating for safer \\ncleaners and degreasers across our industry.\\nWe’ve proactively provided our suppliers a list of cleaners and degreasers that are safe to use, and since 2018, all of our final \\nassembly sites have used only safer alternative cleaners and degreasers.2023 Environmental Progress Report  63 Climate Change Resources Engagement and Advocacy Appendix Introduction Smarter Chemistry\\nInnovation\\nWe’re continually developing our \\nknowledge of material properties \\nto improve the chemical safety, \\nperformance, and environmental \\nimpact of materials. These three \\nfactors drive our assessments of \\nsubstances and help us pursue \\ninnovations that\\xa0align with our  values. \\nThe foundation of these innovations is our work in \\nmapping, assessing, and managing the chemicals used in \\nour products and supply chain. We also look at how these \\nmaterials are used in a product life cycle, from design \\nand manufacturing to end of life. With this knowledge, \\nwe can seek out and support the development of safer \\nchemistries that have an impact, and we can contribute \\nto continually improving the overall safety of our products \\nand processes.Innovating the designs and \\nprocesses used to make \\nour products\\nBy focusing on materials early in product development, \\nwe create opportunities to innovate improvements \\nthroughout the process of creating a product. We assess \\nmaterials for performance, safety, and environmental \\nimpact. These represent our holistic approach to smarter \\nchemistry, allowing us to design for our customers’ needs \\nwhile creating products that exceed expectations and are \\nsafer for use, reuse, and recycling.\\nTo achieve these goals, we focus on the process of \\nmaterial selection. This involves choosing the substances \\nincorporated into our product designs and those that \\nour suppliers use to manufacture our products. Our \\ncomprehensive chemical profiles of each material \\nprovide the basis for each decision. The FMD program \\ndocuments material information  — like composition  — \\nfor\\xa0review by our experts so that a substance’s suitability \\nmeets our standards before it enters our supply chain. \\nThis includes toxicological assessments of each \\nchemical within a material, focusing on those that come \\ninto prolonged contact with skin. Each design choice \\ndetermines the materials included in our product and \\nthe chemicals required to make them. Through the CSD program, we look at the conditions in which a material is \\nused so that we can make recommendations that reflect \\nthe existing controls around a substance. And we work \\nproactively with our suppliers so that their employees are \\nprotected through proper storage, handling, and material \\napplication  controls.\\nOur work considers the impact of materials when \\nour products reach their end of life. We take steps to \\nprevent potential releases into the environment during \\nthe recycling process and to protect those involved \\nin recycling our products. This involves monitoring \\nchemistries that may be harmless in small quantities \\nbut become more concentrated through recycling \\nprocesses. And it also entails assessing how potentially \\nharmful substances impact the recyclability of a material \\nto avoid downcycling  — use of the material in lower-\\nquality applications  — or substances that could make the \\nmaterial unsafe for any use.\\nWe also pursue innovation projects that lead to better \\nproducts. In 2019, we launched a pilot program at a \\nmanufacturing location in China as part of our anodizing \\nimprovement program with the aim of reducing, and \\neventually eliminating, potentially hazardous discharge, \\nas well as reducing water and chemical use. As part \\nof the pilot, we employed several water efficiency approaches, including using cascade and counterflow \\nrinsing processes, which helped retain 75 to 85 percent  \\nof the water used during metal finishing. This process \\nimprovement has the potential to save millions of gallons \\nof freshwater annually when applied at scale.\\nIn addition, we advanced our ability to recover acids \\nused in chemical polishing and anodizing. These acids \\nare typically discarded after one use, but we were able \\nto purify and recycle them back into the manufacturing \\nprocess, reducing consumption by more than 90 percent .\\nThis approach has enabled us to reduce the largest \\nsource of solid waste from the anodizing process, and at \\nscale could potentially eliminate 4000 tons of waste.\\nThe material and process innovations that we develop \\nresult from all these efforts. Our work to share information \\nacross our supply chain, perform detailed process and \\nchemical assessments, and partner with suppliers \\non chemical management lays the foundation for \\nimprovements. We’re able to better protect those who \\nmake and use our products and enable the reuse of key \\nmaterials. And by keeping harmful chemicals out of our \\nsupply chain at the outset, we make it possible for us \\nand others to recover materials for the next generation \\nof products.Creating new, safer chemistries \\nto\\xa0move the industry  forward\\nOur strict requirements that govern potentially harmful \\nsubstances in our products and processes encourage the \\nsuppliers we work with to also prioritize safer materials, \\nhelping create a market for better alternatives. We’re \\nlending our expertise on safer chemistries to help our \\nsuppliers meet the growing demand for safer materials. \\nPrioritizing these materials also means phasing out \\nchemistries that don’t meet our specifications. We’ve \\napproached this across our company and products while \\ninvesting in safer alternatives to drive change across our \\nindustry. The use of safer cleaners today supports the \\ncircular supply chains of the future.2023 Environmental Progress Report  64 Climate Change Resources Engagement and Advocacy Appendix Introduction Smarter Chemistry\\nUsing our research and analysis of materials, we’ve \\ncollaborated with suppliers to find safer alternatives  — \\nincluding for substances where none currently exist. \\nIn those cases, we lend our technical capabilities in \\nmaterial science to work with suppliers to develop entirely \\nnew chemistries. We maintain the same high safety, \\nperformance, and environmental standards for new \\nalternative materials, submitting them through rigorous \\ntesting and evaluation to avoid\\xa0 regrettable  substitutions.\\nPVC and phthalates\\nSubstances that we keep out of our  products*\\n* Apple’s Regulated Substances Specification describes Apple’s restrictions on the use of certain chemical substances in materials in Apple products, accessories, manufacturing processes, and packaging used for shipping products to Apple’s end customers. Restrictions are derived from international laws or directives, regulatory agencies, ecolabel requirements, environmental standards, \\nand Apple policies. Apple products are free of PVC and phthalates with the exception of AC power cords in India, Thailand (for two-prong AC power cords), and South Korea, where we continue to seek government approval for our PVC and phthalates replacement. Apple products comply with the European Union Directive 2011/65/EU and its amendments, including exemptions for the use \\nof lead. Apple is working to phase out the use of these exempted substances where technically possible.This work isn’t new to Apple; we’ve been leading in \\nthe identification and successful removal of potentially \\nharmful substances since the late 1990s. This process \\nhas involved the rigorous assessment of chemicals and \\nthe removal of those that don’t align with our goals  — in \\nsome cases, before removal becomes a requirement \\nand industry standard. We’re committed to phasing \\nout our use of PFAS and engaging with all our supply \\nchain partners to restrict PFAS from our products and \\nmanufacturing processes. While our analysis indicates \\nthat PFAS used in our products are safe during product use, we felt it was important to broaden our scope to \\nconsider manufacturing along the supply chain. We’re \\nprioritizing our phaseout activities in applications that \\nresult in the highest volumes of PFAS reductions and \\nthe most meaningful environmental impact. We’re \\npursuing our phaseout in three steps: compiling a \\ncomprehensive catalog of PFAS uses in our products, \\nidentifying and developing non-PFAS alternatives that \\ncan meet our performance needs, and confirming that \\nnon-PFAS alternatives align with our human health and \\nenvironmental  goals.Read our white paper  about \\nour commitment to phasing \\nout per- and polyfluoroalkyl  \\nsubstances.\\n \\nBrominated flame \\nretardants (BFRs)Mercur y Lead Arsenic Ber yllium PFAS (PFOA and PFOS)\\nWe’ve replaced these with \\nsafer thermoplastic elastomers. \\nBoth are still used by other \\ncompanies in power cords and \\nheadphone  cables.In 2008, we eliminated BFRs from thousands of \\nparts, such as enclosures, cables, circuit boards, \\nand connectors. We use safer metal hydroxides \\nand phosphorus compounds in their  place.We eliminated mercury from \\ndisplays in 2009. We use energy-\\nefficient, mercury-free LEDs and \\nOLEDs instead of mercury-based \\nfluorescent lamps in all our displays.Apple phased lead out of \\ndisplay glass and solder \\nin 2006.Arsenic, traditionally used in \\nglass, has been eliminated from \\nApple display glass since  2008.Eliminated from all new product \\ndesigns, beryllium is found in \\ncopper alloys used to make \\nconnectors and  springs. We eliminated PFOA and PFOS from our \\nproducts, with RSS restrictions added \\nin 2010 and 2013, respectively. These \\ntypes of chemicals are commonly used in \\nmanufacturing water-resistant materials. \\nWe’re committed to eliminating PFAS entirely \\nfrom our products.2023 Environmental Progress Report  65 Climate Change Resources Engagement and Advocacy Appendix Introduction Smarter Chemistry\\nWe’ve focused on cleaners and degreasers  — building \\nout a safer cleaners innovation ecosystem through \\nmultiple efforts. In 2022, we continued our role as a \\nfounding signatory of the Toward Zero Exposure program \\nfrom the Clean Electronics Production Network (CEPN). \\nLed by the NGO Green America, CEPN is a multi-\\nstakeholder initiative to accelerate companies’ efforts \\nto eliminate workers’ exposure to hazardous chemicals \\nand to raise awareness of the need to improve chemical \\nmanagement practices across the global electronics \\nmanufacturing  industry.\\nAs a signatory, we report on the progress we’ve made \\nto remove nine process chemicals from our supply \\nchain that have been collectively identified as priorities \\nfor replacement at our final assembly sites. We’re also \\naccountable for our efforts to protect workers from \\nexposure to potentially harmful substances. We prioritize \\nthis work by emphasizing effective engineering solutions \\nand administrative controls across manufacturing \\nprocesses. While personal protective equipment is \\nessential and foundational to protecting people, we focus \\non employing safer alternatives from the start, and we \\nsupport that with PPE as a measure to eliminate exposure \\nto potentially harmful  chemicals.In 2022, we continued our collaboration with IPC, the \\npremier global electronics standard-setting body, by \\ndrafting and helping launch IPC-1402, Standard for \\nGreen Cleaners Used in Electronics Manufacturing . \\nThis\\xa0standard resulted from work over the past two years \\nwith the Green Cleaners for Electronics Manufacturing \\ntask group, where Apple has served as a chair working \\nwith more than 20 industry partners. This new standard \\nwill help suppliers across the electronics industry \\nselect cleaners that are safer for employees and the \\nenvironment. Last year, Apple received the IPC Stan Plzak \\nCorporate Recognition Award for our work on this effort \\nand our contributions to the industry.\\nWe continued to partner with ChemFORWARD  — \\na\\xa0nonprofit organization committed to creating broad \\naccess to chemical hazard data and a registry of \\ncleaners  — to make it easier for suppliers to choose safer \\nalternatives. We also supported the RBA in producing a \\ncomprehensive technical guide on responsible chemical \\nmanagement, as well as over 20 hours of related training \\ncontent to educate millions of workers across thousands \\nof companies about controlling occupational exposures to \\nhazardous  chemicals.Advocating for safer alternatives \\nacross our industry\\nOur work around smarter chemistry helps facilitate the \\ntransition to safer alternatives that are accessible to \\nothers in our industry. The criteria we set for chemicals  — \\nand how our suppliers use them  — help\\xa0establish even \\nmore stringent standards around health and safety across \\nthe electronics industry. We collaborate with standard-\\nsetting bodies, trade associations, and NGOs to achieve \\nthis — developing tools, standards, and mechanisms to \\ndrive the identification and adoption of smarter chemicals \\nthroughout our supply  chain.2023 Environmental Progress Report  66 Climate Change Resources Engagement and Advocacy Appendix Introduction Smarter Chemistry\\nEngagement\\xa0and \\nAdvocacy\\nWe hear our \\nstakeholders \\nloud and clear\\n2023 Environmental Progress Report  67 Climate Change Resources Smarter Chemistry Appendix Introduction Engagement and Advocacy\\nOur approach\\nApple is committed to achieving clear \\nimpact across our environmental \\ngoals  — and beyond our footprint \\nas a company.

We \\nvalue the input that these forums provide; each helps us \\nunderstand the role that enhanced transparency plays for \\nthose working directly on policy. And these conversations \\nalso offer the opportunity to share information on \\nour efforts.\\nWe engage with the scientific community to better \\nunderstand emerging approaches and cutting-edge \\ntools that can support our environmental goals. We’re \\nworking with researchers at Carnegie Mellon University \\nto create robotic recycling systems to enhance material \\nrecovery for Apple and others through the development \\nof advanced mechanisms for product disassembly and \\nmaterial sorting. We also continue to engage our Green \\nChemistry Advisory Board, an independent group of \\ntoxicologists and experts who advise on our smarter \\nchemistry initiatives, including potential updates to the \\nRSS. Their diverse expertise and perspectives help\\xa0us \\nlead the way to protect our customers and those who \\nmake and recycle our products.This means working with our partners, learning from their \\nfeedback, and providing support where we can make a \\ndifference. We aim to effect positive change within and \\nbeyond our operations and supply chain. And we respond \\nto the world around us by looking for opportunities \\nwhere our leadership can impact policies, industries, and \\ncommunities in a transformative  way.\\nListening to voices from a range \\nof\\xa0backgrounds and experiences\\nWe approach our conversations with others through \\ncuriosity and with the intention of learning from diverse \\ncommunities devoted to environmental stewardship. \\nWe purposefully engage those who bring a range of \\nperspectives and understanding of the issues that matter \\nto us. The conversations we have with policy makers, \\nnonprofits, and community leaders help shape how \\nwe see regulations, approaches, and the promise of \\nemerging technologies. We learn from this engagement, \\ntoo. This process helps us discover opportunities to \\nnavigate challenges and improve in our efforts to achieve \\nour environmental goals. Ultimately, we’re able to put \\nthese conversations into action  — whether that means \\naligning with new standards and best practices or \\nexploring the potential that cutting-edge research can \\nhave on our  operations. 2023 Environmental Progress Report  68 Climate Change Resources Smarter Chemistry Appendix Introduction Engagement and Advocacy\\nEngaging with others has also helped us refine our \\napproach to industry standards and best practices. We \\ndraw from cross-sector engagement platforms to help \\nguide our programs and set standards for environmental \\nefforts. The Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) is one \\nexample of this. Their expertise defines the world-class \\nwater stewardship practices that we’ve implemented at \\nkey Apple and supplier facilities, earning AWS certification \\nfor adherence to their  Standard. \\nWe’re motivated by what we hear from within the \\nbusiness community, including our customers, \\nemployees, suppliers, industry partners, and investors. \\nTheir input provides vital support for our environmental \\ngoals and pushes us further in our efforts. For example, \\nas co-chair of the United States Information Technology \\nOffice (USITO)  — a trade association representing the \\nU.S. information and communications technology industry \\nin China  — we lead the environmental protection and \\nenergy efficiency working groups. In this role, we engage \\nwith other companies in China as we work to comply \\nwith new environmental regulations and with policy \\nmakers on future standards. We continually look for more \\nopportunities to hear from others  — at the industry and \\nnational levels  — to receive feedback and make  progress.Achieving change  together\\nAn important part of leadership is the\\xa0responsibility to \\ninfluence change  — whether through policy advocacy \\nor direct engagement\\xa0with groups invested in issues. \\nCollective action provides the best means to achieve \\nresults on pressing environmental issues. When we \\ntake a proactive role in sharing our experiences and \\ncontributing to collaborative efforts on our areas of focus \\nand expertise, we can better realize the goals on climate, \\nresources, and smarter chemistry that we share with \\nother  stakeholders.\\nPolicy  advocacy\\nPolicy is instrumental in effecting change across \\nindustries. Apple supports climate and environmental \\npolicy through our actions and stakeholder engagement. \\nThis also involves actively advocating for policies that \\nadvance environmental objectives  — and support the \\nParis\\xa0Agreement  — by evaluating the positions of our \\nindustry partners\\xa0to\\xa0align business goals to address \\nclimate  change.\\nFor example, in the U.S. in 2022, we filed comments \\nwith the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \\n(FERC)\\xa0to encourage more rapid integration of renewable \\nenergy to the transmission grid, a key bottleneck to \\nrenewable energy deployment. And Apple, joined by \\nother companies, submitted an Amicus Brief, urging \\nthe Supreme Court to uphold the U.S. EPA’s authority to \\nregulate greenhouse gases from power  plants. In Asia, we spoke at a carbon neutrality conference calling \\nfor Korea’s 2030 energy plan to increase the ambition of \\nits target for renewable energy solutions. And we serve \\nas an executive member of the Japan Climate Leaders’ \\nPartnership (JCLP), a business coalition focused on \\nrenewables and pushing for greater climate ambition in \\nJapan.

The \\nprogram includes live virtual sessions, online courses on \\nsupply chain management, supplier diversity, financial and \\nlegal subjects, and one-on-one mentorship with an Apple \\nexpert on topics from renewable energy to responsible \\nsourcing. Executives and their teams receive customized \\ntraining that provides the knowledge and tools that \\norganizations need to succeed as Apple suppliers, as well \\nas access to Apple mentors and experts to help align their \\nbusiness priorities with Apple’s environmental goals. The \\nprogram culminates in an opportunity for participants to \\npitch their services and solutions to decision makers and \\nbusiness leaders within  Apple. \\nThe companies sustain their commitment after the \\nprogram. Each participant transitions to Apple’s Supplier \\nSuccess community to further foster the connections \\ndeveloped during the program  — and to forge new \\nconnections across all generations of the program. Every\\xa0business is given the opportunity to attend a \\nbusiness executive leadership program focused on \\nsupply chain and growth through a leading  university.\\nOur most recent class featured a diverse set of \\ncompanies engaged in work on water stewardship, \\nrecycling technologies, and green building and \\nengineering, among other areas. The program supports \\nthese companies as they better position themselves for \\ngrowth, improve their abilities to engage larger contracts, \\nand expand their customer base  — all while supporting \\ntheir commitment to the environment. The program \\nhas also connected like-minded business leaders, both \\nwithin our Impact Accelerator classes and at Apple, to \\ncreate new opportunities for innovation and to realize our \\nshared  goals. \\nThe goal of the Impact Accelerator is that Apple’s \\nstrategic work and investments to protect the \\nenvironment also help expand access to opportunity \\nfor communities of color. Since their participation in the \\nprogram, companies have seen increased recognition for \\ntheir work within their sector and local communities, have \\nbuilt connections with public- and private-sector leaders, \\nand have seen their overall business opportunities \\nexpand. Several are currently working with Apple as \\npart of the company’s supply chain network, and every \\ncompany has participated in selective opportunities to be \\nassessed for potential business with Apple.Feature\\nAdvancing our commitment to \\nequity with the Impact Accelerator\\nThe Impact Accelerator’s goal is to ensure that Apple’s work to protect the environment also helps advance equity and \\nexpand access to opportunity for communities of color. Participants, like Bench-Tek, engage in online courses, live sessions, \\nand mentorship throughout the three-month program, and continue their connection with other program participants through \\nApple’s Supplier Success community. 2023 Environmental Progress Report  73 Climate Change Resources Smarter Chemistry Appendix Introduction Engagement and Advocacy\\nAppendix\\nfocusing on  \\nthe finer details  \\nof our progress\\n2023 Environmental Progress Report  74 Climate Change Resources Smarter Chemistry Engagement and Advocacy Introduction Appendix\\nAppendix  contents\\n 99 Appendix D: Assurance and \\nreview statements\\n 100 Net comprehensive carbon footprint, \\nfacilities energy, carbon, waste, paper, \\nand water data  (Apex)\\n 102 Product  carbon footprint \\n(Fraunhofer  Institute)\\n 104 Supplier Clean Energy  Program  (Apex) \\xa0\\n 105 Supplier  Energy Efficiency \\nProgram  (Apex) \\xa0\\n 106 Packaging fiber and plastic footprint \\n(Fraunhofer  Institute) \\xa0\\n 108  Appendix E: Environment, Health \\nand Safety Policy\\n 110  Appendix F: ISO 14001 certification\\n 112 Report notes\\n 113 End notes 76 Appendix A: Environmental data\\n 77 Greenhouse gas emissions\\n 78 Carbon  offsets\\n 79 Carbon footprint by product\\n 81 Apple’s life cycle assessment  methodology \\xa0\\n 82 Energy\\n 83 Resources\\n 84 Normalizing  factors\\n 85 Appendix B: Corporate facilities \\nenergy supplement\\n 94 Appendix C: Supplier Clean Energy \\nProgram supplement2023 Environmental Progress Report  75 Climate Change Resources Smarter Chemistry Engagement and Advocacy Introduction Appendix\\nAppendix A\\n 77 Greenhouse gas emissions\\n 78 Carbon  offsets\\n 79 Carbon footprint by product\\n 81 Apple’s life cycle assessment  methodology \\xa0\\n 82 Energy\\n 83 Resources\\n 84 Normalizing  factorsEnvironmental \\ndata\\n2023 Environmental Progress Report  76 Climate Change Resources Smarter Chemistry Engagement and Advocacy Introduction Appendix\\nAppendix  A\\nWe account for our carbon footprint by following internationally recognized standards, like the World Resources Institute (WRI) Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol and ISO 14040/14044.1 Improving the accuracy of our carbon \\nfootprint is an ongoing process  — as we learn more, we refine our carbon models and adjust our climate roadmap.

The following details the five steps we \\nuse to conduct our LCA:\\n1. To model the manufacturing phase, we use part-by-\\npart measurements of the entire product along with \\ndata on part production. In some cases where part-by-\\npart data is not readily available, we also use design-\\nlevel data for size and weight detail. The measurements \\nhelp us accurately determine the size and weight of \\nthe components and materials in the product, while \\ndata on manufacturing processes and yield loss during \\nproduction allows us to account for the impact of \\nmanufacturing. The LCA includes accessories and \\npackaging, as well as decreased emissions through \\nApple’s Supplier Clean Energy Program. When \\ncalculating Apple’s comprehensive carbon footprint, \\nwe also include units that are repaired and replaced \\nthrough  AppleCare.2. To model customer use, we measure the power \\nconsumed by a product while it is running in a \\nsimulated scenario. Daily usage patterns are specific \\nto each product and are a mixture of actual and \\nmodeled customer use data. For the purposes of our \\nassessment, years of use, which are based on first \\nowners, are modeled to be four years for macOS and \\ntvOS devices and three years for iOS, iPadOS, and \\nwatchOS devices. Most Apple products last longer and \\nare often passed along, resold, or returned to Apple \\nby the first owner for others to use. More information \\non our product energy use is provided in our Product \\nEnvironmental  Reports.\\n3. To model transportation, we use data collected on \\nshipments of single products and multipack units by \\nland, sea, and air. We account for transporting materials \\nbetween manufacturing sites; transporting products \\nfrom manufacturing sites to regional distribution hubs; \\ntransporting products from regional distribution hubs to \\nindividual customers; and transporting products from \\nfinal customers to recycling  facilities.4. To model end of life, we use material composition data \\non our products and estimate the ratio of products \\nthat are sent to recycling or disposal. For products \\nsent to recycling, we capture the initial processing by \\nthe recycler to prepare the product for recovery of \\nelectronic, metal, plastic, and glass material streams. \\nSubsequent downstream recycling processes are not \\nincluded, as these are considered stages of production \\nand not end-of-life processing. For products sent to \\ndisposal, we capture the emissions associated with \\nlandfilling or incineration of each type of material.\\n5. After we collect data about manufacturing, use, \\ntransportation, and end of life, we combine it with \\ndetailed greenhouse gas emission data. This emission \\ndata is based on a combination of Apple-specific and \\nindustry-average data sets for material production, \\nmanufacturing processes, electricity generation, \\nand transportation. Renewable energy used in the \\nsupply chain, initiated by suppliers independently or \\nthrough the Apple Supplier Clean Energy Program, is \\nalso accounted for within the LCA model. Combining \\nproduct-specific information with emission data in \\nour LCA allows us to compile detailed results for \\ngreenhouse gas emissions as they relate to each \\nproduct. The data and modeling approaches are \\nchecked for quality and accuracy by the Fraunhofer \\nInstitute in Germany.*  Myhre, G., D. Shindell, F.-M. Bréon, W. Collins, J.  Fuglestvedt,  \\nJ.

We’ve \\nlearned a lot about how best to \\nsecure renewable energy, which has \\nhelped us educate suppliers and \\nexpand our renewable energy efforts \\ninto our supply chain. This appendix \\nsummarizes the types of renewable \\nenergy solutions we’ve deployed, \\nand\\xa0it details how we implement \\nrenewable energy at our data \\ncenters  — our largest energy  loads.How we procure renewable  energy\\nSince launching our renewable energy program in 2011, \\nwe’ve implemented a number of solutions to procure \\nrenewable energy. Our strategy has evolved over time \\nto\\xa0create the most positive  impact.\\nOwnership and  PURPA\\nIn 2011, Apple’s 100 percent  equity ownership of our \\nMaiden solar arrays was the first time a nonenergy \\ncommercial company built its own utility-scale solar PV \\nproject. We used a 1978 federal law called the Public \\nUtility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) to structure the \\nproject. We then applied this same structure to two \\nmore large solar PV and biogas fuel cell projects in North \\nCarolina and two microhydro projects in Oregon. This \\nwas a landmark moment in corporate renewable energy \\ndevelopment and led to an increased use of PURPA in \\nthese  states.\\nDirect  Access\\nSince 2012, in California and Oregon, we’ve used a \\nprogram called Direct Access to bypass the default \\nelectricity generation offered by the utilities servicing \\nour data centers in those states. Instead, we contracted \\ndirectly with independent power producers who could \\nsupply 100 percent  renewable electricity. After initially \\nbuying from existing, third-party-owned projects, we’re \\nnow procuring renewable energy from projects we \\ncreated: The Solar Star II and Montague Wind projects \\ndeliver renewables to our Oregon data center, and the \\nCalifornia Flats solar project\\xa0delivers renewables to our \\ndata centers, offices, and retail stores in California.GreenEnergy  Rider\\nIn 2013, we opened a new data center in Reno, Nevada. \\nWith no PURPA or Direct Access options in Nevada, we \\nworked directly with the local utility, NV Energy, to create a \\nwhole new regulatory structure. The Nevada GreenEnergy \\nRider enables us to secure a long-term, fixed-price \\ncontract for renewable electricity from a new solar PV \\nproject built for us\\xa0but managed by the utility. We’ve used \\nthis partnership to create four solar projects totaling \\n320 megawatts.\\nEquity  investment\\nIn 2014, we invested in two 20-megawatt solar PV \\nprojects in Sichuan, China, to support all\\xa0our in-country \\nretail stores, corporate offices, and data storage facilities. \\nThis project represented the first time a commercial \\ncompany created a new large-scale project in China for \\nits own use. We’ve since replicated this model many times \\nfor Apple’s supply  chain.\\nPortfolio  solutions\\nIn 2015 and 2016, we adapted to land scarcity constraints \\nin Singapore and Japan by contracting for solar PV on \\n800 rooftops in Singapore and 300 in Japan. We adapted \\nour approach in each country to fit local partnerships and \\nregulatory structures: We signed a long-term agreement \\nsimilar to a power purchase agreement in Singapore and \\nmade an equity investment in Japan. These projects offer \\nus long-term flexibility as our load  grows.Renewable  microgrid\\nSince 2017, we’ve been powering Apple Park with \\n100 percent  renewable energy  — about 75 percent  of \\nwhich is generated onsite and managed by a microgrid. \\nThe onsite generation comes from 14 m egawatts of \\nrooftop solar PV and 4 megawatts of baseload biogas fuel \\ncells. Any additional energy required is drawn by Direct \\nAccess from the California Flats solar project in nearby \\nMonterey County. The microgrid system with battery \\nstorage manages the renewable energy generation \\nand the building’s energy use; optimizes demand \\nmanagement, load shifting, and frequency regulation \\nservices; and ensures uninterrupted energy reliability \\nagainst local grid outages.2023 Environmental Progress Report  86 Climate Change Resources Smarter Chemistry Engagement and Advocacy Introduction Appendix\\nFacilities renewable \\nenergy  projects\\nTo reach 100 percent  renewable electricity for Apple’s \\nown facilities, Apple has helped\\xa0create 1, 549 M W of \\nrenewable energy around the world.

We’re proud that 100 percent  of that electricity \\ncame from clean, renewable sources including solar, wind, \\nbiogas fuel cells, and low-impact hydropower. To cover \\nour needs, we build our own renewable power projects \\nand work with utilities to purchase clean energy from \\nlocally obtained resources. We’re staying at 100 percent  \\neven as Apple’s data center presence continues to grow.\\nWe now operate eight data centers, and more are being \\ndeveloped. These data centers are spread across North \\nAmerica, Europe, and Asia. Each has unique design \\nfeatures that conserve energy and reflect the climate, as \\nwell as other aspects, of its location.Maiden, North Carolina  \\n100 percent renewable since opening June 2010\\nBetween 2011 and 2015, we installed 68 m egawatts of \\nApple-created projects: two 20-megawatt solar projects, \\nan 18-megawatt solar project, and 10 m egawatts of \\nbiogas fuel cells. We then worked with the local utility, \\nDuke Energy, to help build five solar projects through its \\nGreen Source Rider program. These solar projects came \\nonline beginning in 2015 and were Duke Energy’s first \\nGreen Source Rider projects to become operational. We \\nworked with Duke Energy for several years to develop \\nthis green energy tariff option, which allowed Apple and \\nDuke Energy to develop new renewable energy projects. \\nThe five Green Source Rider projects have a combined capacity of 22 m egawatts. In 2017, we made long-term \\ncommitments to five more solar projects in North Carolina, \\nfor an additional 85 m egawatts of clean energy. In 2022, \\nthe Maiden data center was supported by projects that \\ngenerated 432 m illion kWh of renewable energy, which \\nis equivalent to the energy used by over 11,000 homes \\nin North Carolina for a year.2 Use of renewable energy \\nallowed us to avoid over 171, 000 m etric tons of CO 2e \\nduring the fiscal year.3\\nThe energy efficiency measures we’ve implemented at \\nour Maiden data centers include use of outside air cooling \\nthrough a waterside economizer during night and cool-\\nweather hours, which, along with water storage, allows \\nthe chillers to be idle 75 percent  of the time.2 Carbon emissions equivalences calculated using 2021 data from \\nthe U.S. Energy Information Administration: www.eia.gov/electricity/\\nsales_revenue_price/pdf/table5_a.pdf .\\n3 Emissions avoided are calculated using the GHG Protocol \\nmethodology for calculating market-based  emissions.\\nMaiden, North Carolina: Grid mix versus Apple-sourced renewable  energy  \\nElectricity use in 2022: 432 million  kWh\\nDefault grid mix (North Carolina) % Apple actual renewable energy allocation %\\nCoal 16 Apple’s solar projects 75\\nGas 37 Apple’s biogas fuel cells 3\\nNuclear 33 Apple’s wind projects 21\\nHydro 5 Source: 2022 energy data.  \\nNote: Totals don’t add up to 100 percent, due to\\xa0rounding.Renewable 10\\nOther <1\\nSource: eGRID 2021.2023 Environmental Progress Report  89 Climate Change Resources Smarter Chemistry Engagement and Advocacy Introduction Appendix\\nPrineville, Oregon  \\n100 percent renewable since opening May 2012\\nTo support our Prineville data center, we signed a \\n200-megawatt power purchase agreement for a new \\nOregon wind farm, the Montague Wind Power Facility, \\nwhich entered commercial operation at the end of 2019. \\nIt’s our largest project to date, producing over 562 m illion \\nkWh of clean, renewable energy a year.\\nThis is in addition to our power purchase agreement for \\nthe 56-megawatt Solar Star Oregon II project located just \\na few miles from our data center. This solar PV project, \\nwhich came online and began supporting the data center \\nin 2017, produces 141 m illion kWh of renewable energy \\nper year. To strengthen the connection between Apple \\nand these projects, we use Oregon’s Direct Access \\nprogram to supply the renewable energy from these \\nprojects directly to our data  center.Also supporting the data center are two microhydro \\nprojects that harness the power of water flowing through \\nlocal irrigation canals that have been operating for over 60 \\nyears. In 2022, these microhydro projects are expected \\nto generate nearly 2 million kWh of renewable energy. \\nTo supplement these projects, we executed a long-term \\npurchase agreement for all environmental attributes from \\na 69-megawatt portfolio of eight solar projects in Oregon.\\nIn 2022, the Prineville data center was supported by \\nprojects that generated 275 m illion kWh of renewable \\nenergy, which is equivalent to the energy used by over \\n8,000 homes in Oregon for a year.4 Use of renewable \\nenergy allowed us to avoid over 196, 000 m etric tons of \\nCO2e during the fiscal year.5\\nOur Prineville data center takes advantage of the cool \\nand dry climate by cooling its servers with outside \\nair whenever possible.

So, in 2013, we created a partnership with the \\nlocal utility, NV Energy, to develop the Fort Churchill Solar \\nproject. Apple designed, financed, and constructed the \\nproject, and NV Energy operates it and directs all the \\nrenewable energy it produces to our data center. The \\nFort Churchill Solar project uses a photovoltaic panel \\nwith curved mirrors that concentrate sunlight. The \\n20-megawatt array has an annual production capacity of \\nover 40 million  kWh.\\nTo facilitate further renewable development in Nevada, \\nApple worked with NV Energy and the Nevada utility \\ncommission to create a green energy option open to \\nall commercial customers, called the NV GreenEnergy \\nRider, that does not require the customer to fund project \\ndevelopment up front. Thanks to this new option, in \\n2015 we announced our second Nevada solar project, the 50-megawatt Boulder Solar II project. This project \\ncame online in 2017, producing about 137 m illion kWh \\nof renewable energy per year. We’ve used the NV \\nGreenEnergy Rider program two more times, first for the \\n200-megawatt Techren II solar project. Apple’s largest \\nsolar project to date, it’s estimated to produce over \\n540 m illion kWh per year and came online in late 2019.\\nNext was the 50-megawatt Turquoise Nevada project, \\nwhich came online in late 2020.

To support this facility, we partnered with \\nthe local utility, the Salt River Project (SRP), to build the \\n50-megawatt Bonnybrooke solar project, which became \\noperational in December 2016. This project produces \\nover 148 million kWh of clean, renewable energy a \\nyear, which roughly matches the energy used by the \\ndata\\xa0center.\\nAs the Mesa data center grew, it became apparent that \\nwe needed additional sources of renewable energy to \\nmaintain our 100 percent  renewable electricity  goal.\\nWe began to explore onsite solar options at the data \\ncenter and determined that we could provide valuable \\nshaded parking that paid for itself through energy bill \\nreductions while adding to our renewable energy portfolio. \\nThe resulting PV facility includes five elevated parking \\ncanopies and three ground-mounted arrays, for a total generating capacity of 4. 67 M W. The onsite PV system \\nbegan commercial operation in February 2019 and \\ngenerates approximately 8, 000 M Wh per year.\\nIn addition, we began working with SRP to develop a \\ncustomer renewable energy program in 2017, resulting \\nin their Sustainable Energy Offering, which launched in \\n2019, to provide a diverse mix of commercial electric \\ncustomers with new renewable energy at an affordable \\nprice.

The Supplier Clean Energy Program now \\nhas over 20 gigawatts of clean energy commitments, \\nof which nearly two-thirds are operational. In 2022, the \\n13.7 gigawatts of renewable energy online in Apple’s \\nsupply chain generated 23. 7 million megawatt-hours of \\nclean energy, avoiding\\xa017. 4 million metric tons of carbon \\nemissions  — a 23 percent  increase over 2021.1Apple’s clean energy  standards\\nWe help our suppliers select projects with the greatest \\npotential for impact and with a clear carbon, ecological, \\nand social benefit, and we consider the life cycle \\nemissions associated with current and emerging clean \\nenergy technologies. In most cases, wind and solar \\nsolutions meet our criteria. For some energy solutions, \\nsuch as biomass and hydroelectric generation, we \\nreview individual projects so that they deliver positive \\nimpact while minimizing harm. We also uphold stringent \\nassurance standards so that all clean energy can be \\nverified through third-party assessment.2\\nWe want to be a driving force for the development of \\nnew projects and help overcome barriers to bring new \\nrenewable\\xa0electricity online.

This review and verification \\nfocuses on Scope 3 emissions for products sold by A pple Inc. (as defined by \\nWRI/WBCSD/Greenhouse Gas Protocol – Scope 3 Account ing and Reporting Standard). \\nConfidential data relating to product sales and shi pments were excluded from the scope of \\nthis verification.  \\nThis review and verification covers Apple’s annual greenhouse gas emissions and does not \\nreplace reviews conducted for individual product LC As for greenhouse gas emissions \\n(GHGs). The life cycle emissions data produced by A pple for individual products has been \\ncalculated in accordance to the standard ISO 14040/ 14044: Environmental management – \\nLife cycle assessment – Principles and framework / Requirements and guidelines. This \\nreview and verification furthermore complies with I SO 14064-3: Greenhouse gases – Part 3: \\nSpecification with guidance for the validation and verification of greenhouse gas assertions.  \\nThe review of the annual carbon footprint has considered the following criteria: \\n\\uf0a7The system, boundaries and functional unit are clea rly defined \\n\\uf0a7Assumptions and estimations made are appropriate \\n\\uf0a7Selection of primary and secondary data is appropriate and methodologies used \\nare adequately disclosed \\nThese criteria are also fundamental to the review o f LCAs conducted for individual product \\nemissions. The reviewers note that the largest share (99%) of Apple Inc. annual carbon \\nfootprint is comprised of scope 3 emissions from in dividual products. The aforementioned \\ncriteria have been regularly reviewed by Fraunhofer IZM since 2007 with a view to  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Comprehensive Carbon Footprint Letter of Assurance\\nClient: Apple Inc. 2providing independent feedback that can facilitate continuous improvement and \\nrefinement in the LCA methodology applied by Apple Inc.  \\nData reported by Apple is as follows: \\n Manufacturing  Transportation  Product Use Recycling Total base \\nproduct \\nfootprint \\n2022 30.83  1.87 5.06  0.08  37.84  \\n[MMT CO 2e] [MMT CO 2e] [MMT CO 2e] [MMT CO 2e] [MMT CO 2e] \\nMMT CO 2e: million metric tons carbon dioxide equivalents \\nThe total scope 3 product related carbon footprint is reported to be 37.84 million metric \\ntons CO 2e, applying a location-based method reflecting the average emissions intensity of \\ngrids on which energy consumption occurs. This figure does not include greenhouse gas \\nemissions reductions for manufacturing resulting from Apple renewable energy projects, \\nsupplier renewable electricity purchases, and supplier renewable electricity installations.   \\nBased on the process and procedures conducted, ther e is no evidence that the Greenhouse \\nGas (GHG) assertion with regards to scope 3 carbon footprint \\n\\uf0a7is not materially correct and is not a fair represe ntation of GHG data and \\ninformation, and \\n\\uf0a7has not been prepared in accordance with the relate d International Standard on \\nGHG quantification, monitoring and reporting. \\n2 Reviewed Data and Plausibility Check \\nA verification and sampling plan as required by ISO  14046-3 has been established for the \\ncomprehensive carbon footprint review and verificat ion, defining the level of assurance, \\nobjectives, criteria, scope and materiality of the verification. \\nAs part of this review and verification Apple discl osed following data to Fraunhofer IZM:  \\n\\uf0a7Sales data for FY2022, including accessories and including AppleCare, Apple's \\nextended warranty and technical support plans for their devices. \\n\\uf0a7Life cycle GHG emissions for all products, differentiating the actual product \\nconfigurations (e.g. memory capacity) \\n\\uf0a7Calculation methodology for the comprehensive carbon footprint  \\n\\uf0a7Detailed analysis of the comprehensive carbon footprint including: Appendix  D\\nProduct carbon \\nfootprint \\n(Fraunhofer \\nInstitute)2023 Environmental Progress Report  102 Climate Change Resources Smarter Chemistry Engagement and Advocacy Introduction Appendix\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Comprehensive Carbon Footprint Letter of Assurance\\nClient: Apple Inc. 3oThe breakdown of the carbon footprint into life cyc le phases \\nmanufacturing, transportation, product use and recy cling \\noDetailed product specific split into life cycle pha ses \\noThe contribution of individual products and product  families to the overall \\ncarbon footprint \\nThe data and information supporting the GHG asserti on were projected (use phase and \\nrecycling) and historical (i.e. fiscal year 2022 da ta regarding sales figures, manufacturing, \\ntransportation, use patterns where available). \\nThis review comprises a check of selected data, which are most influential to the overall \\ncarbon footprint.

The scope of the fiber and plastic \\npackaging footprint includes Apple’s corporate packaging fiber and plastic usage from \\nproducts, retail operations and Apple care services. The packaging fiber and plastic \\nfootprint tracks the total amount of plastic, virgin and recycled wood fibre, that Apple uses \\nin packaging. Apple obtains and analyses supplier-specific data for each product line and \\nsums up these figures for the entire company using sell-in numbers. For some products, a \\nrepresentative supplier is chosen to calculate the product-specifc packaging. The output is a \\ntotal packaging fiber and plastic footprint. For labels, beats products and accessories, \\nindividual sell-in numbers were only availabe for a share of products. These were \\nextrapolated for the whole category. ESD packages (within Apple care) are excluded from \\nthe packaging plastic footprint.   \\nThe review of the corporate annual packaging fiber and plastic footprint has considered the \\nfollowing criteria: \\n\\uf0a7The system boundaries are clearly defined \\n\\uf0a7Assumptions and estimations made are appropriate \\n\\uf0a7Use of supplier data is appropriate and methodologies used are adequately \\ndisclosed \\nData reported by Apple is as follows: Appendix  D\\nPackaging fiber \\nand plastic \\nfootprint  \\n(Fraunhofer \\nInstitute)2023 Environmental Progress Report  106 Climate Change Resources Smarter Chemistry Engagement and Advocacy Introduction Appendix\\nCorporate Packaging Fiber and Plastic Footprint\\nReview 3Based on the process and procedures conducted, there is no evidence that the corporate \\npackaging fiber and plastic footprint is not materially correct and is not a fair \\nrepresentation of fiber and plastic data and information.  \\nBerlin, March 10, 2023 \\n- Marina Proske - - Karsten Schischke - \\nFraunhofer IZM Fraunhofer IZM \\nDept.

To provide feedback on this report, please  \\ncontact environment-report@apple.com .\\nReporting  year\\nWe track our environmental progress based on Apple’s  \\nfiscal year. All references to a year throughout the report  \\nrefer to Apple’s fiscal years, unless “calendar year” is  \\nspecified. Apple’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period  \\nthat ends on the last Saturday of September.\\nData  assurance\\nWe obtain third-party verification for some of the  \\ninformation in this report from Apex Companies and  \\nthe Fraunhofer Institute in Germany (as denoted  \\nin Appendix\\xa0D ). Data in this report, including data  \\nor verification from third parties, reflects estimates  \\nusing methodologies and assumptions believed  \\nto be reasonable and accurate. Those estimates,  \\nmethodologies, and assumptions may change in the  \\nfuture as a result of new information or subsequent  \\ndevelopments. In addition, the bulk of Apple’s recycled  \\ncontent data is certified and thus verified by an  independent third party. Less than 5 percent  of the total  \\nmass shipped in Apple products in fiscal year 2022 is  \\nrecycled content data that is either supplier verified,  \\nmeaning it has been reported by the supplier and cross-\\nchecked by Apple, or supplier reported, meaning it has  \\nbeen reported by the supplier based on production and  \\nallocation values. In all cases, Apple defines recycled  \\ncontent in alignment with ISO 14021. Product claims are  \\nmade as of the launch date of those individual products,  \\nand they are accurate as of product  launch.\\nForward-looking  statements\\nThe report does not cover all information about our  \\nbusiness.

For fiscal year 2022, Apple has improved its internal data  \\nmodels, resulting in an increase in the total product mass shipped,  \\nthereby reducing the coverage of our priority materials to 87 percent  \\nof the total product mass  shipped.\\n35\\xa0 Recycling makes better use of finite resources by sourcing from  \\nrecovered, rather than mined, materials. Apple defines recycled  \\ncontent in alignment with ISO  14021.\\n36\\xa0 We define biomaterials as those that can be regenerated in a human  \\nlifespan, like paper fibers and sugarcane. Biomaterials can help us  \\nuse fewer finite resources. But even though biomaterials can regrow,  \\nthey’re not always managed responsibly. Renewable materials are  \\na type of biomaterial managed in a way that enables continuous  \\nproduction without depleting the earth’s resources. That’s why we  \\nfocus on sources that are certified for their management  practices.\\n37 Apple reports data about the recycled content of its products at  \\ndifferent levels of fidelity, based on the level of independent data  \\nverification. The bulk of Apple’s recycled content data is certified  \\nand thus verified by an independent third party. Less than 5 percent  \\nof the total mass shipped in Apple products in fiscal year 2022  \\ncontains recycled content that is either supplier verified, meaning  \\nit has been reported by the supplier and cross-checked by Apple,  \\nor supplier reported, meaning it has been reported by the supplier  \\nbased on production and allocation values. In all cases, Apple defines  \\nrecycled content in alignment with ISO 14021. We do not currently  \\ninclude industry-average recycled content, which may result in  \\nunderreporting actual recycled content. Total recycled material  \\nshipped in products is driven by product material composition and  \\ntotal sales  — as a result, this overall recycled or renewable content  \\npercentage may fluctuate based on the number and type of products  \\nsold each  year. \\n38  Apple’s commitment is to use 100 percent  recycled cobalt, on a mass  \\nbalance–system basis, in all Apple-designed batteries beginning in  \\nfiscal year 2025. We calculate our use of recycled cobalt on a mass  \\nbalance–system basis at the end of each fiscal  year.\\n39  Apple’s commitment is to use 100 percent  recycled tin soldering and  \\ngold plating in all Apple-designed rigid and flexible printed circuit  \\nboards beginning in fiscal year  2025.\\n40 Apple’s commitment is to use 100 percent  recycled rare earth  \\nelements in all magnets beginning in fiscal year  2025.\\n41  To account for recycled aluminum, we leverage third-party certified  \\nrecycled aluminum data, as well as supplier verified data, meaning it  \\nhas been reported by the supplier and cross-checked by  Apple.70  Our Mesa and Prineville data centers are third-party certified  \\nas Zero Waste by USGBC TRUE, receiving their certifications in  \\n2021 and 2020, respectively. TRUE requires 90 percent  diversion  \\nor higher from the landfill without the use of waste-to-energy to  \\nachieve the TRUE-certified project  designation.\\n71  All established final assembly supplier sites  — or those that have  \\nbeen Apple suppliers for more than one year  — for iPhone, iPad,  \\nMac, Apple Watch, AirPods, HomePod, Apple TV, and Beats are  \\nthird-party verified as Zero Waste by UL Solutions (UL 2799  \\nZero Waste to Landfill Environmental Claim Validation Procedure  \\n(ECVP).
